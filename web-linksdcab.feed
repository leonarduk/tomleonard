			<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Flickr</em> account of Martin Fowler a Scottish artist currently living in Cumbria. Work goes from quiet and finely observed portraits of life in Perth Prison where he taught painting for a while; to busy socially engaged narrative paintings that stylistically can include both Hogarth and Bellany in their backlight,Â  deconstructing Scotland and its icons. An acid take not designed for staid gallery life or the Creative Scotland no-controversy-please hearties.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poetry publisher under poet Nicholas Johnson, perhaps the last remaining UK small publisher of fullsize poetry books who does not issue the books as Print on Demand digital, but has them printed and published to quantity in careful design. The publisher of Tom Leonard's last four books, Nicholas consulted Tom Leonard on all aspects of production throughout, Tom with wife Sonya designing the front covers on the sewn bindings. The finished product of the last two books, outside the narrative and Definite Articles, has had WordPower in Scotland then weigh in with contributory funding to have the books finally published under joint publisher imprint. The full list of Etruscan's publications here shows their particular bent towards progressive poetry including Americans like Rakosi and Dorn when in their last years.</p>]]></description>
