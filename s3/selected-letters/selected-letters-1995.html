												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thursday January 26th
														1995 </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear N </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The proposition you
														make that I sleep on the train going down and have a rest
														at your place between meeting 15 people to do this
														"workshop", is out of the question. I made it absolutely
														clear from the very outset that I was not interested in
														doing a workshop, but you quite frankly kept blustering on
														that this would be good for other people, of course I
														could do it etc etc etc. Had you mentioned 15 people
														paying &pound;5 (in your latest letter you say you hope
														"at least" 15) I would long ago have told you quite simply
														to forget all about it. Your own way of simply going on
														about an idea without wanting to hear a negative, can make
														it difficult to stop you in midflow. You simply let a
														silence pass then suggest it another way. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The fact is that I do
														have considerable experience of chairing writers' groups.
														In these I receive material, from two participants at a
														time, one week in advance. We read the texts and try to
														work out a democratic and systematic way of making a
														positive response. Often in the past very considerable
														progress has been made: often too one meets resistance
														from those who see the chair as an authority figure whose
														job is to issue art templates. It has nothing whatever to
														do with turning up to meet 15 strangers who are looking
														for "individual attention". Fifteen would constitute for
														me a pretty ideal writers' group size, ideal that is to
														give us enough material comfortably to foresee weekly
														meetings for the next two months without running out of
														material. </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">There are those for
														whom "workshops" are ways of working with other people in
														language-games, or having participants write to a given
														theme which they wander round to see how they're getting
														on, or for impromptu sound-sessions to do with
														performance/ sound work, where the poetry is nearest to
														impromptu vocalisation. That is the way certainly of some
														of the people whom you had in mind to do workshops this
														year. It has nothing to do with my own philosophy of art,
														and I am personally not interested in it. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The abominable word
														that it is, "workshops", is popular with community arts
														officers and the like, who think that it is a way of
														providing funding for the arts whilst making sure that the
														word "work" is involved and none of this nancy-boy
														ivory-towered sweating over individual texts etc. It is a
														kind of cheery canonical penance offered poets who can
														descend from said ivory towers to Do Their Bit For the
														Community and so on. Fuck them all.I'm not doing my
														Community Service stretch: give me the jail guv and let's
														be honest with each other. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">All this, quite
														irrelevant to the fact that I am going to be working like
														hell to have a properly organised gathering for a huge
														crowd of folk on the Friday night, to celebrate,
														unashamedly, thirty-odd years of work. I hope to have
														friends there who have been friends at all times and some
														for most of those years. Were it not for your own event it
														would have been great to have yourself. I will come down,
														to do a reading, for which if it is going to screw you up
														so much what I am doing, I will pay my own train fare and
														will not receive a fee. If you want me to "meet the
														community" get the community into a boozer - after the
														reading - and I will be glad to talk literature, poetry,
														theirs, my own and anybody else's, all night if need be.
														That's what I'm offering: but this workshop, people
														turning up having paid &pound;5 etc - sorry, no,
														absolutely not. That's the way it has to be. </span>

														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I am still working at
														Bell College of Technology in Hamilton where I managed to
														get a writer in residence job for a couple of years. It is
														not awfully exciting but the money was much needed. The
														students don't seem to be particularly interested in my
														being there, potential clients seemed to melt away when
														word broke that I was not an aspiring writers' Plot
														Advisor. But there are some interesting things happening,
														and I was so determined to get out and about away from the
														place this year that I let schools know I would visit them
														if they wanted me to talk to fifth and sixth years. So
														that has been quite interesting, I always get on well with
														the pupils and have worked out a way of talking about high
														and low status language, and things like traditions of
														poetry other than the one that is the sole staple of their
														school exams: the poem as moral philosophical crossword
														puzzle whose subtext, the answer to Six Across etc, is
														known by the teacher and the examining board, etc. They
														are interested in such matters as I reveal to them, and it
														is just a case of whether the teacher is interested in
														their hearing it too. Once or twice the teachers have got
														in the way, and even been quite patronising and so forth
														to muck like me, but generally I am having a good time
														with the visits. For years I wouldn't go to schools
														because of their ridiculous censorship that they wouldn't
														even recognise as censorship, but this way I am at least I
														think getting quite important ideas over that they need to
														hear, and poems too, and how we all own language, it
														doesn't exist in dictionaries but in our mouths in the
														present, we are not born guilty hoping eventually to
														aspire to innocence. And so on and so forth-and-multiply.

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Alan </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I've meant to write
														to you ages ago, and in the light of your last excellent
														letter I meant to write to you a decent long bit of
														script. But bugger it, after a bout of flu and continually
														putting things off I'll just send you a note even if just
														to indicate I'm not a total ignoramus and to say a couple
														of things that won't get said otherwise. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Firstly I enjoyed
														your novel tremendously - I think it's terrific, I'm
														really glad you gave me a copy, and I've been recommending
														it strongly to other people. It's a real place of language
														you've built in that person, that's what I remember
														feeling early as I read it - and you construct so clearly
														such places around her. Anyway I'm not going to go into
														some systematic analysis stuff, sufficient I hope for me
														to say that I think it's a very distinct achievement and I
														look forward very much to what you're going to produce in
														the future. It's also funny, thank goodness: whaur's yer
														Alain Robbe-Grillet noo (I can't remember if we talked
														about him in the Vicky, I've a feeling I asked you if
														you'd read Jealousy or The Voyeur).</span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">As for other things,
														thanks for what you write in the letter. I think I have in
														the best of my work if not a single evident style, then a
														distinct linguistic position across a coherent spectrum.
														If that's been of use to anyone at all I should be
														grateful and stop talcuming my own dick, as I have already
														I fear too much in this regard, in our conversation. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I enclose as promised
														<em>Three Glasgow Writers</em>, containing Young Cecil,
														wot I privately think of as Jim's first great story.
														Honest is here as you can see: it had first appeared in
														Akros, when I can't remember, then was reprinted in an
														American magazine of reprints ( and I was eventually twice
														approached at readings by someone over from America,
														Alabama, who had been totally blown away by it, not I
														think seeing anything ironic, and who I really had to sort
														of say thanks a lot and that but I'm a married man and so
														forth, my first Absolute Groupie). Thinking carefully when
														I wrote it it was not 1970 as I said it was more precisely
														the spring-summer of 1971, when I was unemployed, not
														knowing where the hell I was going, again - and just
														before I met Sonya and soon fucked off to London. Be nice
														if we could make it to either of our launches: if not
														still keep in touch, and definitely give me a buzz if
														you're in Glasgow. Congratulations again on your
														book.&nbsp;&nbsp;

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Philip </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for your
														letter and the obituary. I'm glad you like having the
														"causeries" in one volume; it was a difficult matter of
														balance getting those few informal chat things - like "How
														I Became a Sound Poet" - etc in the same volume with the
														poetry sequences, the articles of close cultural
														criticism, and the political satire and analysis. I
														thought at first Cape were wrong in wanting the Antidotes
														Anecdotes etc bound in with the Reports; but I think the
														layout brings it off. I was afraid some of it might divert
														attention from the seriousness of the Iraq analyses, the
														cultural-educational analysis, and poems like nora, which
														latter is the sequence I most like to read in public - and
														which continues to get very strong response from women at
														readings (I've had to send copies to Switzerland and
														Beirut!). </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The whole development
														of my analysis and stance on culture and education, from
														"The Proof of the Mince Pie" in 1973, I am very happy to
														see continue through the first three essays in the new
														book. Again it's from letters and conversation that I've
														been getting very strong response, which perhaps the books
														now being out together (Intimate Voices is being
														coincidentally republished by Vintage) will perhaps at
														last tempt some serious response into print, other than
														the defensive (perhaps understandably) and rather
														misrepresentational responses I have seen so far in print,
														especially from the educational clerisy. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The whole association
														there, stemming from the poetry, between the nature of
														language-status and the possibility or otherwise of true
														democracy and dialogue, is something inevitably leading
														into the politics and the satires that are really
														expositions of the current political state. All this
														surprise-surprise shite about "sleaze", meaning
														corruption, and the managerial corporate takeover of
														Labour - it pleases me to see that stuff of mine in print,
														laying the fucking thing out a decade and more ago. Nice
														that it got to be printed in London eventually.Anyway. Mr
														McCulloch I seem to remember as a very young and talented
														man indeed with whom I discussed the sacramentalist nature
														of his metaphor&hellip;</span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hope to see you on
														the 24th. </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Sir or Madam </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I have received once
														again your brochure and application forms for the courses
														in creative writing at Madingley Hall summer school. I
														seem to have received these regularly in recent years: why
														I am not sure, perhaps it is somehow connected with the
														tutors in these courses and the fact that three years ago
														I was invited to read my poetry at Anglia Polytechnic
														University - and have been invited back to read later this
														year again. Presumably that I am invited back means that
														it is not suggested my work would benefit from creative
														writing tuition. Actually I teach it myself in my own
														writers' residency in Bell College, Hamilton. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">What I am writing
														about though, other than to suggest I be removed from the
														mailing list on which my name and address evidently
														appears, is the application form itself. I have to say
														that even if I was a budding writer looking for tuition,
														as distinct from a writer twice invited to read at the
														college in which some of your tutors teach, I would not
														consider filling in the application form sent me. I refer
														- of course - to the "ethnic origin" section. That it
														should be considered appropriate to list Bangladeshi,
														Black African, Black Carribean, Black Other, Chinese,
														Indian, Pakistani, Other Asian, Other, Prefer Not to Say,
														and "White" - seems to me in the compiler (and in those
														who acquiesce in its being sent out) to display the poetic
														sensitivity of a saracen tank. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">If one is really to
														be so skindeeply "precise", does it not then matter
														whether the "white" person is American or Australian,
														Scottish Irish or Welsh, whose first language is English,
														Gaelic or Afrikaans? This no doubt is the byproduct of
														some performance-indicator "equal opportunity"
														well-intentioned but wrongheaded instruction from
														administration. It reminds me of the "Strathclyde Region,
														a nuclear-free zone" caption on Strathclyde Region
														notepaper: every month Trident missile warheads are
														ferried at night through the centre of Glasgow by lorry to
														Coulport base. But the slogan sounds nice, and it's
														awfully reassuring. </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyway, thanks for
														sending the stuff but please remove my name from your
														mailing list.</span>

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The book I recommend
														strongly, <em>The Malta Language Question: A Case
															Study in Cultural Imperialism</em> (Geoffrey Hull) is
														published by Said International Ltd, 43 Zachary Street,
														Valetta. The publication date is listed as 1993, though it
														was March 1994 when it was being reviewed (very
														inadequately) in the Malta Times, the month I bought it in
														Sliema. ISBN 99909 43 08 7. I don&rsquo;t have the exact
														price, I think it was the equivalent of about &pound;20 I
														paid for it. Well worth it, a superb piece of scholarship,
														clearly laid out with lots of photographs, 10&rdquo; x
														6&rdquo;, over 400 pages.
													</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Other books on Malta
														I bought to cross into the Hull were <em>Religion and
															Politics in a Crown Colony: the Gozo-Malta Story
															1798-1864</em> (Joseph Bezzina) Bugelli Publications 50 St
														Lucia St Valetta, 1985 &pound;5.50, paper. I&rsquo; ve
														only read bits of that, a history from a Catholic
														perspective. Also bits of <em>Party Politics in a
															Fortress Colony: The Maltese Experience</em> (Henry Frendo)
														Midsea Books 3A Main Street Valetta, 2nd edition 1991
														&pound;7 paper, now out of print I think. That was
														recommended by a bookseller as the best account of
														political party development though I tired of it a bit.
														The book apart from Hull&rsquo;s that I enjoyed the most
														was <em>Saints and Fireworks: Religion and Politics
															in Rural Malta</em> (Jeremy Boissevan) Progress Press Co Ltd
														341 St Paul Street Valetta, I paid I think &pound;3
														Maltese for it. It&rsquo;s very funny (in a nonpatronising
														way) as well as very detailed about the social structures
														of rural life and the part played by church in relation to
														religious festivals, rival town bands and politics.
														It&rsquo;s a book well worth having if you haven&rsquo;t
														come on it. ISBN 99909 3 000 7.
													</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was fighting a
														virus at the weekend and had to go home during the day on
														Saturday and go to bed until Sunday. I&rsquo;m sorry I
														missed the reading on Saturday night. All the best. </span>

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear M </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thought it about time
														I said hello again, goodness knows when was the last time
														you had a letter from me. In fact I think there&rsquo;s
														another one on my disk somewhere, just begun then I went
														out somewhere. Anyway: this one to the closing curtain. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is a new computer,
														an Apple bought with the loot from my writing residency at
														Bell College in Hamilton, which has six months left to
														run. Bell has been ok, a bit too businesslike in some ways
														the place, I suppose all public services have gone that
														way, certainly in this part of the world. Sonya was
														telling me recently that principal teachers are no longer
														called principal teachers, but Cost Centre Operators,
														which I thought was a nice little piece of getting the
														priorities right. Britain is awash with that managerialist
														shite just now, change the language change the culture. I
														sometimes think that no-one is doing anything else at Bell
														but teaching people something called Interview Skills, so
														that when the five thousand go after the one job, 4,999
														can realise they haven&rsquo;t quite acquired the
														&ldquo;interview skill&rdquo; yet. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I can&rsquo;t
														remember if I told you but the first time I went for
														interview to the college I was required to do a ten-minute
														flip-chart presentation, which was how I first got to know
														what a flipchart is. I wasn&rsquo;t going to go along as
														one read of their letter told me that they used language
														in a way I&rsquo;ve fought all my life and will fight till
														I drop, but I was advised rightly that maybe somewhere
														inside the Machine there was someone actually wanting me
														to apply so that some breathable air could be imported, if
														only for nostalgic purposes. So it proved, though there
														has been a bit of tension, not all of it creative. On
														being asked at the outside to establish my
														&ldquo;targets&rdquo; I pointed out that I always thought
														a target was somebody&rsquo;s finger in my back, though I
														did happen to be reading a book called The Destruction of
														Dresden at the time, which certainly showed how to
														establish one&rsquo;s targets and achieve them. Target
														markers first, then high explosives to take out the
														windows and roofs, then blanket incendiaries for
														furnishings etc towards the firestorms; couple of hours
														pause for the surrounding regional helpforces to reach the
														city, in again with another wave of bombers. One thing
														about Harris - he knew his Cost Centre Operators. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">---- </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I will add another
														recent poem to fill it up: a party-piece of one-liners,
														consequent on a debate over the years with Jim Kelman
														about the way poetry gets more status than prose. Quod
														Leonard etc. In fact it&rsquo;s too big - I&rsquo;ll print
														it on the back.</span>

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Got down to it at

														make sure to keep that time free.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The book reviewed at
														last in the Glasgow Herald yesterday. Headline, PRICKLY
														POET WHO THINKS STRAIGHT. Apparently I am a prickly and
														thrawn poet, which perhaps accurately describes my
														relationships with Glasgow Herald journalists over this
														past decade though is maybe not a useful description of
														the book. I was going to send a card to the bloke who
														wrote the review - it&rsquo;s honest and decent enough by
														his own lights - saying I&rsquo;d rather be prickly than
														phallocentric. Maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t have got the irony
														though as a friendly gesture. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;I have got so
														far as to acquire the heavy cream paper I&rsquo;ll be
														doing a run of silkscreen prints on perhaps at the end of
														the week, or rather my friend Euan Sutherland will be
														doing them for me. So I would hope to be able to give you
														one when you&rsquo;re up, if I don&rsquo;t send it by
														post.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks again to
														yourself and Val for making worthwhile what was otherwise
														an extremely dreich affair that I couldn&rsquo;t really be
														bothered with. I was really exhausted by the time I got
														home on Saturday, more or less just crawled into my bed.
														I&rsquo;m very pushed in Bell just now getting ready
														various things for a local radio station I probably
														mentioned to you. We&rsquo;ve the long weekend here and
														Sonya&rsquo;s over in Dublin visiting her mother,
														I&rsquo;d hoped to get a lot of work done but not much so
														far. Yesterday centred round watching Celtic on telly in
														an Irish pub down the city centre. What an abysmal game,
														Celtic&rsquo;s manager Burns thinks flair is something you
														walk on. One nothing up against Airdrie and he &ldquo;puts
														the damper on&rdquo;, as the commentator put it.
														You&rsquo;d think it was Inter Milan they were playing
														against.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Have got via someone
														who used to work in the South Bank and is now up here
														working on a Helpline project I think it&rsquo;s called,
														the complete Paul Blackburn out the poetry library. I
														think Blackburn&rsquo;s prosody is masterly, would like to
														set about writing something about it, which I think I will
														do in the next few weeks. He&rsquo;s the guy for me who
														really picked up on Williams&rsquo;s punctuation, at any
														rate I really very much admire what he does on the page,
														and think I&rsquo;d like to write about that, for my own
														sake as much as anything else. See you soon I hope. </span><br />

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear H</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I am over in Antrim
														at the beginning of next week to read at the John Hewitt
														summer school. I see Patrick Crotty is on the bill too.
														All part of the peace process!</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Enclosed is one of my
														feeble linguistic satires. Actually I&rsquo;ve been
														writing a deal of poems recently which Lines will be
														bringing out. And my friend&rsquo;s small stained glass
														panel - the representation of &ldquo;all livin language is
														sacred&rdquo; based on maritime flags, was finally hung
														before my south-facing study window yesterday afternoon.
														It&rsquo;s more muted than expected, but it&rsquo;s got a
														fine presence. You must come up and see my stained glass
														sometime - as the bishop said to the actress.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sonya and myself took
														an impromptu three-day break in Pitlochry last week on the
														impulse of fine weather being reported up there. Good
														walking, though the town itself markets an awful
														sonsiness. We had a day at Blair Atholl, sunbathing in the
														grounds that is, having decided not to give the bastard
														five pounds each to look at his antique dinner sets. The
														highlight of the day if not the break was the small
														bookshop at Blair Atholl railway station - a converted
														petrol station, open noon till 8, and well worth a visit,
														usually tea or coffee and a blether being also available
														we were foretold. I restricted myself to a copy of
														Hogg&rsquo;s The Poetic Mirror , one of a print of 700
														from 1921, the Scholastic Press, a refugee from Darlington
														Library - I love that book, I think it shows what a great
														critic Hogg was, in those parodies; also a small book
														Plays of the People by TM Watson, of whom I&rsquo;d never
														heard, three one-acters first performed in 1928/29 by the
														Labour College Players in Keir Hardie House, Glasgow; and
														an 1896 The Songs and Life of Lady Nairne.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It being 1896,
														there&rsquo;s nothing but approval for her supposed
														lifelong work in &ldquo;purifying the national
														minstrelsy&rdquo; - though unfortunately the attempt
														&ldquo;to publish a purified edition of Burns&rsquo;s
														songs&rdquo; did not succeed - and how it all really got
														under way after her footman handed her a small collection
														of ballads &ldquo;many of which were ill-suited for the
														hands of youth&rdquo;. It can be easy to send up this sort
														of thing and belittle her achievements, but nonetheless
														it&rsquo;s so important all this it seems to me. I know
														Willie Donaldson has done something on it, but really the
														effect of this takeover and bourgeousification of the
														Scottish culture by this salon class has not been given
														nearly enough attention. So much still seems to be taken
														as the legacy rather than the reinvention.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">What did further
														interest me in the biographical bit was how after her
														husband&rsquo;s death she went over to where he was born
														in Kingstown as then was. In 1831 &ldquo;she left
														Kingstown and established her residence in Enniskerry,
														county Wicklow, a locality not only well adapted for Lord
														Nairne (her son)&rsquo;s health, but calculated to evoke
														her own poetical inspiration. Lady Nairne was favourable
														impressed with the warm-hearted character of the Irish
														peasantry; but she deeply lamented to find a generous
														people crushed under the iron heel of a selfish
														priesthood. The song, &ldquo;Wake, Irishmen, wake&rdquo;,
														composed at this time, is sufficiently expressive of those
														sentiements, and of her earnest wishes for the dawn of
														spiritual life among the sons of Erin. She admired the
														songs and music of Ireland. She read the poetry of Moore,
														but lamented that he, like Burns, had not always been
														careful to consecrate his verses to the cause of
														virtue.&rdquo;</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is from
														&ldquo;Wake, Irishmen, Wake&rdquo;:</span>

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">She must have been a
														welcome sight &ldquo;in her pony carriage when she visited
														the dwellings of the poor.&rdquo; She was there for two
														years until 1833, apparently a familiar face at
														Powerscourt, where she became really pally with the
														Viscountess, and where she met &ldquo;many gifted
														clergymen form England, Scotland, and the Continent, who
														rejoiced to assemble there for friendly discussion and
														social fellowship. From the pastoral gatherings at
														Powerscourt one was seldom absent whose deep spirituality
														and simple earnestness attracted and charmed even those
														who most deplored his errors; this was Edward Irving, then
														on the verge of a great future. &ldquo; The baroness
														&ldquo;doubtless lamented his painful delusions.&rdquo;</span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Who knows in her
														wanderings thereabouts what the Wogans or the Leonards of
														yore have done to influence the Purified Scottish
														Minstrelsy. Let the work continue!</span><br /> <span

														able to come round to the Scotia umpteen weeks ago when
														you hailed me from a car en route to same in Argyle
														Street. I&rsquo;d have loved to have come round, of
														course, but duty in the form of a writer coming in from
														Uddingston to see me at Bell College at 2pm that day,
														meant I had to get on the red bus.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">One other thing: I
														have an article that I wrote about Sonya&rsquo;s
														father&rsquo;s poetry - &ldquo;The Moment of Innocence and
														the Moment of Experience: The Poetry of Thomas
														O&rsquo;Brien&rdquo; - that I would like to see published.
														It was written for inclusion in a book of essays about
														him, and including a selection of his poems, that the
														O&rsquo;Brien Press in Dublin have recently published. He
														founded the Press shortly before his death twenty years
														ago, and the book itself arose partly as memorial, partly
														because his work had been taken up by the East German (as
														was) literary historian Gustav Klaus, author of several
														books on working class British Literature. Sonya&rsquo;s
														father faught in the Spanish Civil War, he was active in
														Left and amateur theatre politics in Dublin in the
														forties, and his life is an interesting one.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I like his poetry, at
														least some of it, very much. My essay was partly the
														settling at last of a debt owed since he published, as a
														wedding present, my collection Poems of 1973.
														Unfortunately I was a bit late getting the essay in, you
														will be unsurprised to hear, but more importantly it very
														much does not follow the marxist-historical line that
														Klaus - though a brilliant researcher - tends rather drily
														to bring to his prose, and to the book itself. So the book
														was published without my contribution. In fact in working
														out an appreciation of Thomas O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s poetry
														I found myself continuing in the analysis about Being and
														the moment that has been edging around my criticism over
														the years. Perhaps because we shared the same kind of
														former Catholic, Left and
														never-able-to-get-over-the-simple-fact-of-existence way of
														looking at things, I think I managed to get really close
														to his mind in the work, and further developed my own
														thinking.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Maybe that&rsquo;s
														overstating it, but it&rsquo;s been read with a very
														gratifying response by a number of people, and I know
														Philip Hobsbaum for instance sent it on to Heaney. If
														you&rsquo;re interested I will send it, having added the
														little personal intro and concluding couple of sentences
														it presently lacks. Perhaps it might make amends for
														certain occasions when I have been unable to meet your
														requests for other critical prose.</span>

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for the card.
														We had a good time in Antrim for our few days, Sonya and
														I, really stimulating experience. I found it very
														refreshing being with people in conversation with whom
														there were very distinct disagreements but with distinct
														areas of mutual respect. Also Sonya was much taken by
														finding amongst the public in attendance, two former
														acquaintances of her father in his political days -
														including a neighbour in Dublin who confided that his
														close friendship with Tom O&rsquo;Brien had never been
														replaced. Plenty of animated political talk there, and I
														was somewhat moved to see Sonya&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s
														friends going home with some of my own books, twenty years
														on. A strange feeling.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">What a beautiful part
														of the world: Bernard MacLaverty and Madeleine happened to
														be staying on holiday not far away, and drove us around
														Cushendall, Cushendun and thereabouts.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Enough chatter.
														Enclosed are a few more new things, From the Insitution is
														what I reckon they are part of as a kind of sequence.
														Don&rsquo;t bother to reply if you&rsquo;re up to the eyes
														in it. The &ldquo;Firmly&rdquo; one lay in my bottom
														drawer for a couple of months, then when Sonya was
														describing her headmaster&rsquo;s conversation with her
														when Bellarmine wanted to cover up the fact that she had
														had money stolen in the classroom - I realised that it was
														eerily close to the words of the poem I had written.</span>
												</p>

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Came on the card you
														gave me at the Radical Book Fair while looking for my
														specs there, and it reminded me that E said a couple of
														days ago you would be over in October. It prompted me to
														think I&rsquo;d say hello, so here you are. Actually I
														thought I&rsquo;d send you one of the poems I&rsquo;ve
														been doing recently, am glad to say I&rsquo;ve been
														writing some poems again. Lines Review asked me if I would
														give them some poems when I had some, and this is one of
														the ones they will be printing in the next issue.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It&rsquo;s actually
														based on lying listening to a discussion on Radio Five, at
														any rate that&rsquo;s what prompted me to begin writing
														it. Late night &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; mainly shrieking
														on about the Serbs. After the latest Krajina business I
														saw an American senator on telly saying it had &ldquo;made
														the Croats very popular over here&rdquo;. Once again
														glimmerings of another viewpoint occasionally on RTE - who
														unlike the BBC have reported the Helsinki Watch report on
														Croatian systematic village destruction, four mass graves
														apparently round Knin, and &ldquo;disinformation&rdquo; as
														they call it about casualties. It&rsquo;s horrible if
														predictable the way the media phrase &ldquo;ethnic
														cleansing&rdquo; suddenly became taboo at the moment when
														more people were being driven out of their homes than at
														any other time in the preceding years: the Guardian and
														Independent continue to be as appalling as Michael Foot,
														the insufferable Clare Short et al; the letters page of
														the Scotsman, dense with that Canongate - connected mob
														ranting on about the Serbs in the most violently racist
														manner, needless to say momentarily cleared. The Scotsman
														has actually been better sometimes than the others though
														there&rsquo;s some Kurt something or other now ferrying
														the one-viewpoint shite fairly regularly into the paper.
														Channel Four News of all places has been the worst, some
														guy Gabo I think his name, during the Krajina expulsions
														he managed to find a destroyed Croatian house to talk
														about - and end his report &ldquo;from liberated
														Croatia&rdquo;.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">That
														American-German-Croat axis. (&ldquo;Castlemilk - on the up
														and up&rdquo;). At least the bastards found something to
														do with the East German weapons. Anything in the way of
														where to get reports I can&rsquo;t get here - I wish I
														spoke Greek to hear eg Radio Greece - I&rsquo;d
														appreciate. Hope all is well with you.</span>

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear R</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The writers&rsquo;
														workshop I&rsquo;d been asked to do in Dublin has fallen
														through: I hadn&rsquo;t really had much hope of it from
														the beginning, in that it was to be part of the Dublin
														Theatre Festival and I&rsquo;m not a dramatist; also the
														money side had not been made too clear other than paying
														my fares and lodging, so I think when I got a bit concrete
														on that score they found that certain sponsors had
														ufortunately not come good etc etc. Anyway though I would
														have liked a visit to Dublin again and, I would have
														hoped, to see yourselves, I&rsquo;m not too bothered as
														the &ldquo;workshop&rdquo; concept is one that never
														excites me in the first place, nor indeed that I ever
														really understand. I think too often it&rsquo;s a way that
														committees agree to put up a small amount of dough for
														writers on the basis that something called a
														&ldquo;workshop&rdquo; means that at least they
														won&rsquo;t be in their ivory elitist tower and so on, but
														they will be doing some &ldquo;work in the
														community&rdquo; - like community service instead of jail.
														Of course the events can be useful, and I&rsquo;m a strong
														believer in local writers&rsquo; groups for getting people
														to recognise they have as much right to be creative as
														anyone else, and they&rsquo;re not isolated freaks behind
														their domestic curtains. I&rsquo;ve chaired hundreds of
														those, without calling them workshops.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I enjoyed Antrim very
														much. The whole of this &ldquo;revisionist history&rdquo;
														angle was something I hadn&rsquo;t got in touch with
														before. It was exciting to be conversing with people with
														whom one had distinct disagreements on certain matters but
														with mutual and genuine respect for the integrity and
														intelligence of the other. I have found Edna
														Longley&rsquo;s The Living Stream very challenging and
														clear, albeit I have had a good argument with it in places
														in the margin.</span>
												</p>

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">If you are in
														Scotland I hope of course that you will come and visit us.</span>

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear S</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for the poem.
														It looks fine and reads very well - though in fact looking
														at it, and having your reading of it on tape in my head, I
														wonder if single column and increasing the spacing between
														the lines might be an idea: the phrases themselves carry
														weight, and the pauses you gave it might well be
														unashamedly given more weight themselves. I don&rsquo;t
														know - please let me consider that anyway when typing it
														up for this hoped-for mag: I might feel once done that it
														would be better as you sent it, but perhaps not.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Enclosed is the
														anthology of which you should have received a copy but
														didn&rsquo;t. Also a flyer I received this morning for a
														reading next week in the Clutha. I doubt if I&rsquo;ll be
														there but it might be a way for you to pick Bobby Christie
														or Jim Ferguson&rsquo;s brains as to where poetry of your
														formal area and politics might safely be sent just now.
														The truth is that I don&rsquo;t know myself, I had thought
														to find lists at the back of one of the previous Out from
														Beneath the Boot anthologies, but didn&rsquo;t find any.
														You could also write to Jim Ferguson - again. Also I
														enclose a spare Out From Beneath the Boot: this last issue
														was not as interesting I don&rsquo;t think as some
														previous.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Regarding the reading
														by the way, Sandra Craigie is worth hearing, a good
														ordinary working class poet from Edinburgh, her
														stuff&rsquo;s strong and verbally interesting, and
														she&rsquo;s not a self-publicist either. A book from her
														is overdue: she told me at the Stephen Lawrence benefit I
														read with her at recently, that she&rsquo;s publishing the
														book herself. Which is a damned disgrace but tells you
														maybe what you (don&rsquo;t) want to know about the
														wonderful open vibrant etc etc publishing/poetry scene in
														this Sceptred Isle, this jewel set in a silver sea.</span>

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Philip</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks very much for
														the Arthur Jacobs. He has his own place, when he comes
														through, doesn&rsquo;t he - if &ldquo;having his own
														place&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t too ironic a paradox given his
														content. I share that sense of being very specifically
														touched, in a queerly unsettling way. &ldquo;A Jew in
														Glasgow&rdquo; could obviously be set beside
														Cernuda&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Cemetery&rdquo;. And I like
														very much the ending of &ldquo;Hampstead Heath&rdquo; -
														though I wish he had more successfully concluded
														&ldquo;Lost in the Sea&rdquo;, which I think very fine and
														striking until the closing lines, which muddy it a bit for
														me. &ldquo;For the Makers&rdquo; naturally makes me wish
														we had spoken together - or perhaps even we did, who
														knows.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I suppose you saw
														Patrick Crotty&rsquo;s sallying forth upon me in last
														week&rsquo;s TLS. I have to say I wonder if he knows I was
														in for the Scottish chair. Not unlikely - Riach was off to
														South Wales for a sojourn trying to track down Welsh
														MacDiarmid material after we met in early June (I hoped to
														phone him before he left with the name of the librarian of
														the now dissolved South Wales Miners&rsquo; Library, which
														I visited in 1984, but couldn&rsquo;t find the name in
														time). Anyway it doesn&rsquo;t matter and I don&rsquo;t
														suppose it would have made any difference to
														Crotty&rsquo;s rather condescending stance: but I may ask
														the man himself when I see him. We&rsquo;re both down to
														attend a John Hewitt summer school in Antrim in a couple
														of weeks.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Antrim school
														looks a wee bit dreich, though I think the titling of
														lectures, with ponderous subtitle, is a genre as peculiar
														in its own way as the names of houses, and horses. Perhaps
														some of the lectures might be better called
														&ldquo;Eventide&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hillfoot&rdquo;, whilst
														many a home might be better described as
														&ldquo;Pandora&rsquo;s Box: Conflict and Irresolution in
														Scottish Gender Discourses&rdquo;. Ach well, as my family
														motto reads, All metaphor and no metonymy makes Jacques a
														dull boy.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Rosemary may have
														mentioned, Sonya and I are just back from a few days break
														in Pitlochry, where walks were walked, and air deeply
														inhaled. The town itself is a little unrelenting in its
														genteel sonsiness, perhaps all it lacks is a permanent
														staging of John Cairney in There was a Man. The boys are
														somewhere in Europe on an international railway card:
														they&rsquo;re away for a month. When they return in 10
														days Michael will be preparing to start work in the Royal
														at the beginning of August. We&rsquo;re proud as can be
														about him. They didn&rsquo;t tell me I might be fathering
														doctors when I went to Our Lady of Lourdes in Cardonald.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I hope you and
														Rosemary find the Galapagos tortoises up to scratch.
														Enclosed is a copy of a poem Alasdair sent, cheering me up

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I wasn&rsquo;t sure

														warned that this character, if real, has evidently got
														wind, and is on the loose. I thought when you mentioned on
														the phone that most of the women in your book &ldquo;tend
														to have moustaches on them&rdquo;, that you might be
														expecting some of this stuff chucked at you. It&rsquo;s a
														bit of a shock to see it though, and the book not even out

														looking at the sea on the shore, was Britten&rsquo;s Four
														Sea Interludes. It&rsquo;s a very distinctive place, the
														sea is so present, so near and totally to the horizon,
														which itself seems quite high somehow. Shades of greyness.
														I read with Lauris Edmond, whose work I didn&rsquo;t know
														but the compassion and directness of which I like very
														much. We got on extremely well, like meeting an old
														auntie, sharp as nails, who recognises you as that cousin
														of Bella&rsquo;s she&rsquo;d heard about. Shared irony in
														writers goes an awful long way. I hope I meet her again,
														we had a good walk and talk.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Enclosed is the
														latest offering from my Muse a week or so back, offered en
														passant when my teeth just happened to be against the
														wall. Like a Quaker prayer a bit, though Paul Blackburn
														whom I have been reading is maybe next door. In a month I
														might ditch it, though I like it for the way it came to my
														rescue, and I read it to Sonya.</span>

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp; </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;">Wednesday November 9th
														&lsquo;95</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear M</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for your
														letter. I owe a lot to George Bruce, from a specific
														kindness and act of unselfishness that I will not forget.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I left Glasgow
														University in 1969, having had a good time over 2 years,
														edited Gum, met a lot of friends like Tom McGrath, Philip
														Hobsbaum, Aonghas MacNeacail and Alan Spence, and having
														done a power of drinking and talking with same. The only
														snag was the lectures, which I found a bit of an irritant,
														and tended to avoid them. At any rate I left University
														after two years.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">After I got married
														and moved to London in 1971 I found myself with a new baby
														and a landlord who wasn&rsquo;t too fond of tenants who
														had babies, as these were inclined to be more difficult to
														move. My wife Sonya and I turned our thoughts to returning
														to Glasgow. Going back to University - we had gone to
														London when she had also an unfinished, though finishable,
														degree - seemed the best option.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I can&rsquo;t
														remember when I had first met George Bruce. I think it was
														when we met up in a BBC Radio Scotland Studio appearing on
														the same programme to read our poetry. At any rate George
														was now the first Writer in Residence at Glasgow
														University. Getting back into Glasgow University would be
														very difficult for me: I would need to get &ldquo;an
														extension on my class ticket&rdquo; to use the jargon, to
														resit second-year English; and even then the only viable
														option I could see would be to re-sit second year taking
														the new Scottish Literature course as a double towards a
														possible honours with English. But how could I persuade
														the university I was prepared to work this time?</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">George went to it on
														my behalf - I think I must initially have written to him
														then spoke to him - and did a lot of work persuading
														people that I should be given the chance. He was total in
														his commitment to getting it done for me, and completely
														self-effacing about it, as I say I will not forget that
														kindness, and the attitude he showed in doing it.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I worked very hard
														that summer, got back in, eventually got my degree. The
														postgraduate work on Thomson that I did eventually in turn
														led to my Thomson book. Without George&rsquo;s help none
														of this would have come about.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I&rsquo;ll always
														feel grateful for that. </span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<hr />
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;">Tuesday November 21st
														&lsquo;95</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear M</span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;">I&rsquo;m glad if some
														improvement is discernible in the health position,
														especially if it does not require surgery in the end. Over
														here I am becoming familiar with friends&rsquo; sagas of
														gallstones and internal workings ( it must be the age
														we&rsquo;re all arriving at), of trying to get quick NHS
														treatment without having to jump the queue by going
														private. On the good side there does seem to be so many
														things now that new drugs or microsurgery can deal with
														very efficiently, without massive incursions. I wish you
														well.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">&hellip;..</span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"></span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;">I .... felt you would not
														be unwelcoming to a satire on an exaggerated type of
														selfrighteous mindset, for which a chance phrase had been
														taken as occasion by me; one of those
														&ldquo;editor&rsquo;s finds&rdquo; genre things (like
														those listed in &ldquo;The Present Tense&rdquo;) that I
														thought you would just take as part of the joke. I did not
														at all think you might think it was &ldquo;real&rdquo;, I
														am not such a bastard and hope I never will be. Given what
														you&rsquo;ve said I can see very clearly though how it
														could set alarm bells ringing. I just wish I hadn&rsquo;t
														sent it, that&rsquo;s all really I can say.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">At least it&rsquo;s
														forced me in some ways to try to see some of my own
														muddled perspectives, more clearly. The women&rsquo;s
														poetry festival I organised at Bell College, for instance,
														centred on Kathy Galloway, Gerrie Fellowes, Margaret Cook,
														Ann Tall, Kathleen Jamie. It presented a spectrum of
														writing (most of the poetry writing in Scotland that
														interests me among the younger set is as it happens by
														women just now) going from a kind of depiction of victim
														of violence (Margaret Cook has some terrific stuff here,
														genuine and moving in the language, not &ldquo;adopting a
														current theme&rdquo;) to people in their different ways
														making maps of a self-in-the world that really goes way
														beyond both victim and gender sets. I really love Kathleen
														Jamie&rsquo;s new Queen of Sheba - I was tutoring an Arvon
														Week course with her when I first read it - and Kathy
														Galloway, who came to a Maryhill Writers&rsquo; Group I
														chaired for a while, gave me there a terrific sequence
														Stations of the Cross . Kathy&rsquo;s work presents by
														times her postition as a kind of Kierkegaardian, erotic,
														feminist theologian Church of Scotland minister. Cop that.
														A very sensitive writer, former warden of the Iona
														Community. Work like Kathy&rsquo;s exploration of
														consciousness is what excites me (and what was meant to be
														one of the ingredients of Places of the Mind ) and what
														disgusts me in relation to the kind of anti-existential
														off-the-peg hysteria I was having a go at.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Enough, enough. Some
														sunshine. I read at the Aldeburgh Poetry Festival a couple
														of weeks back with Lauris Edmond. We got on great
														together, and I really like the directness and compassion
														in her work. She said she hopes I make it to New Zealand.
														If I ever do, that will be someone else I would definitely
														be looking forward to seeing. We had a really enjoyable
														walk along the shore the morning after the reading before
														I went for my train. It goes a long way when you find you
														share the same irony with someone else. Nor did she sound
														like an announcer for Radio Three, which nearly everyone
														else down there did.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Also. I forgot to
														tell you. John Purser and I bumped into each other again
														&hellip; He gave me a cassette of his new radio play Apes
														and Parrots, about Ruskin and the Irish sculptors at work
														on the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. A really engrossing and
														well constructed piece of work, lasting exactly, as I told
														him later, the time it takes for an intercity train to
														travel from Stirling to Inverness. Fine dialogue - and
														beautiful scenery.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I have been dabbling
														in the Glasgow lied again . Results overleaf.</span>
												</p>

												<hr />
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span><br /> <span
														style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;Wednesday December
														27th &lsquo;95</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Suzanne Mason</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for your
														letter of December 5th, which finally reached me about a
														week before Christmas. Unfortunately its arrival coincided
														with the arrival of the flu virus in my house, but I now
														have enough energy back to reply.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I&rsquo;m glad that
														you enjoyed the poem, and that you took the trouble to
														write. I enclose a copy: it appeared amongst a number of
														my new poems in issue 134 of the Edinburgh Poetry Magazine
														Lines Review, which can be bought from Lines Review
														Edgefield Road, Midlothian EH20 9SY, price &pound;2 plus
														36p postage. I&rsquo;ll list my books in print at the foot
														of this letter in case that interests you.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I had been travelling
														since 7 am from Glasgow via several train changes to the
														Aldeburgh Festival the day of the broadcast, and was
														obliged to fall into the Kaleidoscope reading immediately
														on arrival. An ex further-education college early-retired
														person like yourself came up to me after the reading, and
														was keen to tell me that the poem had articulated what he
														himself felt about things, so that was good to hear too.
														There&rsquo;s a lot of awareness, quite sorely too, about
														what&rsquo;s going on, but not enough articulation of it.
														For myself I loathe the culture/language change that has
														quietly and ubiquitously taken place within this past few
														years, dressed everywhere in &ldquo;targets&rdquo;,
														&ldquo;performance indicators&rdquo; &ldquo;mission
														statements&rdquo; &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; etc etc
														and all the rest of the accompanying cost-functionalist
														jargon. It&rsquo;s anti-human, and anti-existence.
														Till-centred, not person-centred.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyway that&rsquo;s
														my opinion. Good luck in your own retirement: if you like
														my poem it probably means unfortunately that you&rsquo;re
														well out of it.</span>
