												<p>April 20, 2011</p>
												<p>Hi C------</p>
												<p>I'll just put those poems to the side for now and
													read them later, thanks for sending them I am interested in
													seeing what you are doing.</p>
												<p>Re what you are asking about my extempore remark
													about the dangers in creation, it was really specifically
													in relation to recording techniques such as I have used. I
													think creation can be dangerous, you should be prepared to
													go as far as you can and you might not be in a very good
													condition for what you are dealing with. We can talk about
													this sometime. I don't have much time for getting worried
													about "poetry as therapy" or whatever: the difference to me
													is always a) intention b) a work of art is an instance of
													the human, a work of therapy is an instance of a human.</p>
												<p>Or something like that. Anyway I was sorry to hear
													you had been in the place where things come to a halt, I
													have been in that layby several times in my life, and hope
													never to go there again. No sharps beyond this point. It
													can be heartening to remember Les Murray's description of
													depression as "poet's flu".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
												<p>It woud be good to have a talk sometime, about poetry
													or whatever. You look grand now, wherever you've been.</p>
												<p>all the best</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>

												<p>Dear -</p>
												<p>
													I used to have a Robert Buchanan book but all I can
													remember is that I found dreary what little I read, and it
													found its way to Oxfam with a big clearout I'm sure, can't
													find it anyhow. I think it was <em><i>The City of
															Dream</i></em> so it was probably pertinent to what you say of his
													work. I've just finished a response to an essay I was asked
													to look at for a magazine as peer review I suppose it's
													called, on the poet David Gray. He as you probably know was
													a friend of Buchanan's and they went to London from Glasgow
													together, but Gray got TB and had to come back to Scotland
													where he died just before his 24th birthday. Gray's work
													isn't particularly good but I find his sequence of sonnets
													"In the Shadows" written during and about his terminal
													illness interesting, a few of them worth remembering and
													worth considering in the light of recent American poets
													like Ed Dorn or Paul Blackburn writing of and in terminal
													cancer.
												</p>
												<p>
													Fromm was one of the geezers I used to read quite avidly in
													my early twenties but some of it I think was as much out of
													a selfremonstrative moral hypochondria as much as
													enthusiasm. But I know folk who admire his work a lot and
													he is due for another read from me; I now only have <em><i>The
															Sane Society</i></em> on my shelves but I haven't got down to it
													again yet, and it has been there quite a while. His and
													other authors' works used to find their way into my hands
													in the midsixties as I worked at that time in the Glasgow
													University bookshop at the corner of Bank Street, before
													both parts of the shop moved as one into the university
													itself.
												</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>

													<em><i>[Written after a reading at an art festival
															held within Fettes College Edinburgh]</i></em>
												</p>
												<p>August 6, 2011</p>
												<p>Dear H</p>
												<p>It was good to see yourself, you are looking in fine
													fettle. I found the reading initially difficult as I wasn't
													sure what people were there for, so who the audience was.
													They hadn't paid &pound;35 to hear me, that I knew. But I
													found the accoustics ok so I just got into my stride; the
													fact that I was breathing a bit easier yesterday than I
													have been lately helped me and made me almost enjoy the
													experience of being able to read properly again. When my
													new CD comes available that I recorded on April 29th you
													will hear I was a bit more breathless, I had to edit out
													some of the noises from my chest at the end of longlined
													poems like 100 Differences between Prose and Poetry.
													Yesterday there was no problem.</p>
												<p>The reading after me that you missed was basically
													just a kind of first-year uni lecture on Muriel Spark esp
													Prime of Miss Jean, with a slideshow going on of
													nondescript views of Edinburgh that bore no relation to
													what was being said. The title was The Transfiguration of
													the Commonplace and I was transfigured enough to stay awake
													till the end of it.</p>
												<p>The arts collective folk who organised the whole
													business were very agreeable people, but Fettes College
													itself I absolutely loathed. A depressing place with no
													sense of love of children about it whatsoever, but shabby
													fake grandeur and cliches of Scottish authority and sham
													"history" everywhere. Even the old wood in that classroom
													we were in, ho yes historic Fettes wood with the cuts and
													letters of FP's. It really makes my spirit heavy even
													remembering it; somehow it made me think of Thomson in the
													Caledonian Asylum. Wherever you looked it wasn't home, but
													you were supposed to feel grateful and somehow "proud" of
													this richfolks' notion of a Scottish-British Entity. I
													could feel sorry for some of the sensitive kids who might
													have been there; though not for the selfconfident on their
													way to assuming the power they would assume to be theirs.</p>
												<p>I'll send you the CD when it comes out.</p>

												<p>The middle of the night. I pause by the computer
													before I go back to bed.</p>
												<p>I will postpone going through the proofs tomorrow as
													I want a day off and away from it, and my chest has been
													breathless today. And your email left me with a heavy heart
													and a bitter taste in my mouth.</p>
												<p>What is it about prose that even an editor who
													respects the integrity of your writerliness in poetry,
													assumes the reins of an interfering "editorship" as soon as
													prose is the issue in hand? Then I am treated, even from
													you, to dreary and banal unimaginations like "consistency"
													in points of orthography when what you mean is
													standardisation: and that you have not digested my opinions
													on the effects of a meticulous inflexible standardisation
													in nineteenth century orthography, its removal of print
													from the presence of the person... I just get sickened
													having to "explain" what my fingers do to someone, when my
													fingers know my breath more than the other can apparently
													even begin to understand. A word like 15, fifteen. The fact
													is, each takes a different length of time to articulate. A
													rhythm is affected, is at issue. The cougher-in-ink to whom
													the page is silent will of course at last have their day in
													court, at last they can be "on home ground". Fuck them. You
													say you have felt like shooting editors when you read a
													book. I wholeheartedly agree, the only difference being
													that I would shoot them before they began their work on
													mine, not after it.</p>
												<p>As for "was" and "were" in A Taboo Too Far. Oh fuck,
													it is just like when that banality at Cape was drearing
													through my script: one has to delve into the articulacy of
													explanation for that which is intuitive and the intuitive
													is always, always the right mode in my writing. It takes
													time, anger, tiredness to try to "explain" the reason for
													the intuitive. In this case it actually comes down to a
													class-national fine point of articulation, that for me to
													have said "were" would, at a microlevel of my consciousness
													especially as an imagined child of that time, seem too
													"posh" a usage, too "English" for a workingclass Scottish
													boy, without being one who spoke particularly broad. To
													have to drag this out, this "reason", I find offensive. I
													know you mean well and have been assiduous in trying to
													help me to my way. But trust me. I go back to bed.</p>
												<p>Tom</p>
												<p>ps And I know that in my tiredness I misspelt
													intuitive a couple of times. That's just a typo, to correct
													typos is always a good thing for an editor to pick up, it
													is not a matter of deep style.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>

												<p>Dear</p>
												<p>..... Only when I enter with an audience like up in
													Fraserburgh, where I was angry enough to have forgotten I
													still had my bunnet on (Sonya told me later I was still
													wearing it) do I then get absolute, entire rapport with the
													people who are listening. None of the pastors of their
													flocks are directing them to the event. Only when this
													shepherd wanders by do they get it, and know I am one of
													them.</p>
												<p>.... Just as I say that the only circumstance with my
													work I need is for the face to be at the page my face was
													over when making it; so when I am face to my work in the
													presence of others, if it happens, people there come to the
													aural page in the same way. Some will disdain that too and
													speak witheringly of "humour" that low-status tinker's
													nonliteracy. My only bolster is the warmth of response made
													individually at the party north of Aberdeen, folk just
													"taking me in", and I could sit with them as part of the
													crowd having given them my inside.</p>
												<p>.... I don't hate anybody, and I keep coming back to
													the Blank. That's the problem even if the solution. The
													Blank has to be part of the work. But people don't want to
													admit to the Blank. It gets political in a way that they
													need their pastors to tell them don't worry, it is ok. Nay
													doot they will in time when there are different networks,
													or maybe they won't, it's the face at the page and in the
													dark air that counts. No intermediary! Maybe that last will
													get me a "Scottish" seal of approval.</p>

												<p>Dear</p>
												<p>If was a great pleasure to hear from you again and
													receive your kind enclosures. My collection of prose that I
													mentioned in the past is now going through the printers and
													I should have copies around the end of next week. One will
													be making its way over to Derry for you.</p>
												<p>
													I love McGowran reading Beckett so that CD is very welcome
													as is the John Montague. My first experience of Jack
													MacGowran was in a performance of Beckett&rsquo;s monologue
													television drama <em><i>Eh Joe</i></em> which was broadcast
													on BBC TV in the sixties. A play that would have been a
													deal less interesting but for MacGowran&rsquo;s voice and
													that hugely expressive face of his.
												</p>
												<p>I hope the chemo is not too exhausting and that it
													helps usefully delay progress of the cancer to give you
													some decent time. I always remember many years ago, when I
													was in my twenties about 27 I think it was just about when
													I was getting to know Sonya before we got married; and i
													used to be bothered with breathlessness then as I still am;
													and I had had to go to the outpatients at the local
													hospital to get an injection to ease my breathing, I think
													Sonya was with me. Anyway I went for a cup of tea in a
													small hospital cafe tearoom which was located at the
													entrance to the cancer treating section of the hospital,
													just a fairly dowdy wee cafe with nothing fancy about it. I
													don&rsquo;t remember the details of the place, what I do
													remember is a man sitting in his pyjamas at one of the
													tables near the door, and he just looked over at me.
													That&rsquo;s all. There was nothing spectacular or dramatic
													about the look, but I just got a sense of it being a look I
													could not forget, it was from a place that we both knew
													there was nothing there but it itself. One day it might be
													me of course but it was not just now. So I got on and right
													away forgot the look and went on with my life. But
													it&rsquo;s still there the look fifty years on,
													that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
												<p>
													I&rsquo;ll send you my book <em><i>Definite
															Articles</i></em> in a couple of weeks.

												<p>-----</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Wednesday August 25th 2015</p>
												<p>Dear J</p>
												<p>How good to hear from you, I have thought of you a
													number of times over this past while, though it was wrong
													of me not to put thought to paper. I'm sorry to hear your
													spirit has not always been great I suppose with your cancer
													and the chemotherapy that is not at all hard to understand.
													But it is good you are here John and I hope your days give
													a bit more ups than downs if possible. Prostate at least
													seems to be one that doesn't just wheech you away forthwith
													through the exit door, and without marking down what you
													have to endure with prostate, I think pancreatic is the one
													I most want to avoid , it steals up unawares then wheechs
													you away indeed but not without unpleasantness before you
													go. The neighbour upstairs whom I think I mentioned before,
													it must be eight years now since he told me he had prostate
													cancer, he seems to be holding up fortunately. He's a
													motorbyke fiend, though about the same age as myself (I was
													71 last weekend) but what is worrying to his younger wife
													is that their son is a motorbyke fiend too. He's come off
													it a couple of times, and I know that when I was in
													orthopaedic after a fall thirty years ago it was young
													biker men in their twenties that provided a conveyor belt
													supply to orthopaedics where they lay with their legs in
													traction up in the air. And they were the lucky ones.</p>
												<p>I don't do so much readings in Scotland these days
													though I had a couple of decent visits abroad earlier in
													the year, to a poetry event in Bergen and another in South
													Tyrol. The latter was to a place called Lana in the
													German-speaking province of Bolzano in northernmost Italy.
													I was given an award there in memory of a local poet NC
													Kaser who also wrote sometimes in dialect and was also a
													bit of a Leftie and troublemaker. So I ticked all the
													boxes. The only box I didn't tick I am glad to say was that
													whereby he died of drink in his thirties. I managed to get
													out of that one by going on the Appletiser and giving my
													liver a last chance to regroup thirteen years ago. So I'm
													still here too...</p>
												<p>For that reason I won't be able to have a drink on
													that money you sent, which you shouldn't have, but I accept
													it in the spirit offered, which is to say I accept it with
													gratitude and intend to buy a wee CD box of Furtwangler
													wartime recordings of Beethoven which I have had my eye on
													for a month or so on Amazon, and which your cheque will
													cover very nicely. So be assured my spirit will be fired up
													indeed by your gift when it is turned into music. I find
													more and more that music is the place that makes sense to
													me. When my mind is just fed up with the damned place,
													which it shouldn't be but there you are, it seems that
													listening to Bach for instance, some of it, my thoughts
													become the pulse of the ongoing musical narrative, and my
													brain is just straightened out, and sorted out. With Haydn
													I sometimes get a laugh. Not a belly laugh, but he is witty
													and inventive as well as such a bottomless well of
													musically satisfying explorations. It was music that saved
													me in me mixed up youth, and here it is in auld age when I
													have nothing to complain about at all, really, being rather
													a lucky fellow just now; here it is saving me still. And
													all because this thrawn young man didn't want to listen to
													Radio Luxembourg with his big brothers, but as my mother
													said wearily often enough "You just aye have to be
													different!" So I got listening to Radio Three even though I
													didn't like it very much, but grew to love the music on it.
													There you are. That's something the BBC did for me. That
													and the arrival of long playing records at budget prices,
													just as I was in my late teens.</p>
												<p>The other work in art that has been giving me a lot
													of pleasure recently is Chekhov short stories. I love
													Chekhov, the Constance Garnett translations, and Sonya's
													Dublin father&nbsp;used to have a number of the short story
													collections in the St Martins Library 13 volume set that
													came out early in the twentieth century. I was rereading
													the story "Ward Number Six"again there. What a piece of
													work, and insight. I remember the psychiatrist RD Laing,
													dead now, telling me that that was one of his favourite
													stories. If you know Laing's work you would know why: the
													doctor in a provincial area by a rundown hospital in the
													back of beyond, who finds the local townsfolk all boring
													apart from the postmaster who visits him once a week; the
													hospital that he knows lives on delusion and is twenty
													years behind the medicine of Moscow; and Ward Six near the
													gate, a ward with six mentally ill patients for whom there
													is no hope, and whom the warder on the door beats at his
													whim. And the doctor one day finds himself visiting and
													talking to a young man who displays the symptoms of what
													would now be called, though not in Chekhov's day, paranoid
													scizophrenia. The man, who had been hospitalised after
													slowly disintegrating on having seen a prisoner in chains
													in the street and being unable to understand why it was not
													himself but this person who was suffering; this patient
													tells the doctor that he is a fraud, that the world is
													sick, that the patient is suffering far more than the
													comfortable philosophising doctor ever can understand; and
													the doctor finds him interesting. So the doctor begins to
													visit the patient daily, and spend more and more time with
													him. Never is he given other than bemused contempt by the
													patient. And people begin to talk, about this doctor who is
													always spending time with this patient. The doctor is
													called to a meeting of governors, and he is politely asked
													at one point if he knows what day it is, and what is the
													month. Coming away, he realises they have been testing to
													see if he is sane. The postman has become a bore, though he
													insists on taking the doctor on a holiday to try to make
													him better. Then the doctor one day is invited to the ward
													by an inspector, who leaves; and time passes, and he
													realises he is not getting out. The warder who beats the
													patients gives him some clothing. But next morning, having
													been beaten by the warder and waking to realise he is there
													for the rest of his life, Chekhov releases him with a heart
													attack.</p>
												<p>Oh dear, I have made it sound depressing, actually I
													think it is a wonderful piece of writing, the way Chekhov
													tells it (!!).</p>
												<p>I'll just leave off now, though I will include some
													of the little postcards I have made of cartoons or posters
													I have put up over the past few years on my internet
													website journal. I kept that going from 2009 until
													September 2014, but gave it up as it had become a bit of a
													duty and current politics was to me indeed depressing. So
													pastures new had to be sought forthwith.</p>

												<p>
													<span>Hi J----&nbsp;</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span>Thanks for dropping me an email, your own self
														has flickered in the auld Leonard skull a few times in the
														dark with attendant wonderings as to how you are. Not much
														to report here of note in the public domain, though I am
														reading at a charity gig for Huntington's disease sometime
														soon apparently around St Andrews Day. Quite happy in the
														old self, one of the benefits of old age in the seventies
														is that a drop in testosterone seems to herald long quiet
														thoughts that the hopeful young interpret as looking the
														wisdom of age.&nbsp;</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span>A matter of considerable pleasure too has been
														the election of Corbyn, one of the freak miracles that is
														truly a laugh consequent on the Diversity Neoliberals
														thinking they could risk running that old lefty fucker in
														the corner just to show how democratic their stoogedummy
														elections were. And democracy intervened!!! Oh precious,
														listening to the endless queue of Blairite horrors in
														meltdown in the Guardian, the New Statesman let alone the
														BBC and all the Telegraph Mail etc etc mob. Wonderful. And
														being asked on Murdoch's Sky television for his response
														to the Sun's revelation of supposed links with Hamas,
														replying "I'm sorry, I don't read the Sun..... &nbsp;Do
														you?" Oh to have lived for such words. Not just south of
														the border too, the ubiquitous journalist-commentator
														describing Corbyn in the Sunday Herald (where else)&nbsp;
														as "a waste of space" shows just how pampered the favoured
														Holyrood inner circle have become, and how petulant they
														are when Corbyn doesn't bother his arse with them for
														interviews.&nbsp;What I love about JC (the earthly one) is
														that he doesn't do soundbites for a favoured press corps
														running a pseudo presidency from a daily podium. This is
														entirely new, north and south of the border at the moment,
														and the press just don't like that at all, they're
														supposed to manage democracy in tandem!! That way they can
														smirk at one another in studios, get their daily columns
														hot from the horse's mouth, and have a nice five years
														getting to know one another in the favoured diners. Isn't
														everyone happy and that what democracy is supposed to be
														about?</span>

													&nbsp;<em><span>Dear Mr. Leonard,&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em>
												</p>
												<p>
													<em><span>I'm a Norwegian journalist working

												<p>
													<em><span>Therefore I am wondering if you have

												</p>
												<p>
													<strong><span>1<em>.Rimbereid

												</p>
												<p>
													<em><strong><span>2.You are scottish

												</p>
												<p>
													<em><strong><span>3.You are obviously

												<p>
													<span>---------------------------</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span>Dear Dag Eivind Unheim Larsen&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span>I prefer my work to be the place where my
														thought is apparent in its own context rather than
														something existent away and outside of the work
														itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span>Your saying that I previously supported
														independence but did not take a position. Am not sure if
														that is the Wikipedia entry you have been looking at,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>probably
														written by one of the nationalists who write about
														Scottish Literature these days. My dialect work when it
														appeared between 1969 and 1979 was attacked most
														vociferously by the Scottish nationalists even more than
														the British nationalists. I am neither a British nor a
														Scottish nationalist, if I have to be called an "ist" then
														socialist will do, and humanist in addition. Language is
														an instance of the human not of the nation. I am on the
														side of the speakers of low-status language since I have
														been born into such a condition; the nationalist is one
														who would seek high status language as the privilege of
														governance. I have been interested in the music of the
														language-pool of my social class in the West of Scotland,
														purely because it is in my mouth and I am a language
														activist by the fact that I exist. Writing my dialect
														poems was not an act of nationhood nor of class but an act
														of existence in the face of denial.&nbsp;&nbsp;
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span>I am interested almost reluctantly in
														politics, but not in party politics. Politics is the
														mechanics of power, and language is part of that politic.
														But the politics for me is the assertion of authentic
														existence not of nationhood. All art is such an assertion,
														and it is something that is the right of all to attempt to
														engage in as part of their right to play in the world, not
														simply to control or colonise it. As Brecht (whose Mother
														Courage I have recently translated) knew, in a society
														corrupted by power drives such as profit, then the
														language itself becomes corrupted. In parliamentary
														democracies just now such corruption exists through the
														lobby systems and the ubiquity of public relations;
														politicians and journalists tend to rely on one another,
														in a sense they can become laterally interdependent for
														their living. That is another area of language I find
														myself engaged in, again not by choice but because it is
														everywhere in the media, though like all linguistic
														colonisation it tends to be invisible to the colonised.
														Making it visible can be a constituent of empowerment but
														also of simple play, which is itself a form of
														empowerment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span>Regarding the recent referendum and election
														in Britain. Two weeks before the election took place,
														there had taken place in Scottish waters the biggest ever
														Nato exercise ("Joint Warrior") consisting of 55 warships
														70 fighter aircraft, and 13,000 military personnel from 14
														countries. None of the British political parties, and none
														of the Scottish parties including or perhaps least of all
														the Scottish National Party, thought this worthy of
														mention. I am interested in politics, not political
														parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span>yours sincerely&nbsp;<br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span>Tom Leonard</span>
