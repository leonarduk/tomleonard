													Sunday November 5<sup>th</sup> &rsquo;06
												</p>
												<p>Dear J</p>
												<p>I meant to get this to you before now but here it is
													anyhow. Don&rsquo;t know that it will all be to your
													interest but some of it may be. You&rsquo;ve maybe seen it
													all on the net before.</p>
												<p>Was watching a film of Sorley Maclean on the net last
													night. Brought back a lot of memories. He was the most
													wonderful reader of his poetry, you really felt you were
													just in the presence of something really great and
													absolutely unique: but at the same time totally
													representative of a people, a history and a person. His
													voice in reading moved me very deeply, the only other poet
													whose reading has had a similar effect or a different but
													very moving effect was W S Graham. I have a CD now at last
													of Graham reading. I would send you a copy but don&rsquo;t
													know if you have a player to listen to it. He&rsquo;s not
													stirring and uplifting in that astonishing bardic way that
													Sorley was: but his intimacy and precision, and sense of
													love and geometry in his voice, is very probing and
													memorable. In a way Sorley&rsquo;s voice is like one
													crossing the centuries, a person speaking to generations:
													Graham&rsquo;s is one voice in the here and now Present,
													crossing the infinity between the inside of one mind, and
													another.</p>
												<p>I have not been writing much this past few months,
													though I am not bothered yet. I was just so glad to get
													this booklet behind me, and to have had the short run that
													it represented. Will try to be patient waiting on the next
													one.</p>
												<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Thursday, February 7, 2008</p>
												<p>Dear L</p>
												<p>That's really very helpful to have this burnt to DVD,
													I'm very grateful to you. I'll probably play it at three or
													so readings over the next few months then just go back to
													reading the poem straight as is whenever I do read it. It's
													the poem that counts, but I just like to kind of give it
													that added dimension for a few birls anyway, as much
													because it is images that are excluded here as anything
													else. I did in fact not include some images that I got that
													were more horrible in their gruesomeness than what I
													included, but I didn't want it to go down that road and
													could be accused of being sensational. One of a dead boy
													with a bullet hole in his stomach turned to the camera on a
													hospital trolley, and a number that came up recently of
													these so-called clinical targetted assassinations in the
													streets from the air, which in fact as the photos I
													downloaded show, are just ghastly to look at, the usual
													mess of people blown apart. But what was really horrible
													about these, that did make me almost incline to use them,
													was that in several photos showing the fragmented remains
													of a person, and one of a father picking up a bundle of
													rags with the top half still containing what was presumably
													his son, in each of these in the background a child in the
													street could be seen gazing at what was in front of him.</p>
												<p>The look tended to go right through me in each of
													them, very difficult to describe, a look of almost musing
													perplexity or something: reminded me of when I was at a
													Celtic-Rangers match years ago at Parkhead and I was
													sitting just a wee bit along from the Rangers section.
													Rangers must have scored, at any rate there was the silence
													all round the park apart from the Rangers bit not far from
													us, which had broken out in a very militaristic thing, it
													was wierd it must have been some UVF chant or song or
													something, but they were banging in rhythm on the seats in
													a kind of march as they sung this really triumphalist
													thing. It was chilling actually, another of the reasons why
													a few years later I walked out of a Celtic Rangers match
													before half time and never went back. But anyhow at this
													game where I was sitting near the front at the Celtic end
													just along from the Rangers corner, I don't remember what
													the score was that day or who was playing. But I do
													remember that as that triumphalist thing was being done by
													all the Rangers fans, there was this ballboy behind the
													goal near us who was standing looking in the direction of
													the Rangers people doing their marching thing. And the
													expression on his face just got to me, I don't even
													remember the boy's face, I just know that I was suddenly
													shocked by his expression. He didn't look shocked, it was
													just something else.</p>
												<p>Thinking about it and in relation to the Palestinian
													boys' at the side looking at the dismembered bodies, it's
													something to do with the stillness of them, and their
													expression. I think it's probably to do with dissociation,
													that the child being present at something that takes them
													into a different conscious state momentarily, something
													that they will always remember in their heads, so there's a
													slight questioning. And the whole business of dissociation
													and trauma is another can of worms that probably I was kind
													of recognising, that this was a moment out of the normal
													time of childhood. Anyway, it shook me up. And seeing the
													expression, not of horror or shock, but just a kind of
													stillness in those Palestinian children's faces was more of
													a shock to me than the sight of the bodies they were
													looking at.</p>
												<p>Am in the Mono on Tuesday night where if they have
													the equipment I will give the DVD a birl thanks to
													yourself. If they don't have it I'll just read the poem.
													Another anti-war thing run by Naseef but I won't expect to
													see you there, though I hope to have the DVD definitely up
													for the Art School gig with Adrian Mitchell you said you
													will be at. Look forward to seeing you then.</p>
												<p>Thanks again that's brilliant of you.</p>

												<p>Oct 2008</p>
												<p>Dear K</p>
												<p>I was politicised in some ways by first writing my
													Six Glasgow Poems in 67 then having to work out why some
													people were actually saying I &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t write
													like that&rdquo; and others hated or looked down on them so
													vehemently. I had to work out clearly over the years,
													through a series of essays, my feelings about the hierarchy
													of diction in British speech practice, ditto in relation to
													what in Britain, as distinct from America, was considered
													&ldquo;suitable for poetry&rdquo; and so on. Though in fact
													the things I later articulated were implicit from the
													start, which is why they annoyed some folk so much, from
													the start.</p>
												<p>When I married and moved to London in 1972 for a
													year, I got involved in politics for the first time as I
													was angry that the landlord wouldn&rsquo;t give us a
													rentbook and various things; also this was near the
													beginning of the Irish &ldquo;troubles&rdquo; consequent on
													1969, and I found myself sucked into analysis of the
													language of reporting these, and its language variants in
													different media and the same media at different times of
													the day. I then got involved in analysing the shifts in
													power in the structures at the top of the Labour party and
													the TUC; so much of it for me was an analysis of language,
													getting angry at what I saw as the abuse and complicity of
													language. That has always been my way in, right through
													subsequent booklets against the Iraq war in 1991 and so on.
													It&rsquo;s always at the level of language, which is where
													it impinges on me, I feel the bloody thing like bombs
													coming out of the electronic media and Press. I have I
													think remained fairly consistent though I do not think
													static: I have stayed outside of the party system, which in
													Glasgow where there is a one-party state which has been
													such for decades, staying distinct means you not only lose
													out on feedings from the cultural trough, but for any
													political criticism they never forgive you. Their resort is
													to stereotype the likes of Kelman and myself as
													&ldquo;angry and unrepentant as ever&rdquo; which is how
													the local "quality" paper dismissed a reading I gave a few
													days ago, despite its being very far from an angry reading
													indeed my having been thrown off my rhythm at one point by
													the audience laughing so much. But I stay outside the
													city&rsquo;s tight wee cultural-political-journalistic
													circle of patronage, and of course one pays for that. It
													means I don't get their sweeties, but it's the only place
													with enough air to breathe.</p>
												<p>The business of a so-called classless society is a
													difficult complex thing. The collapse of the Soviet Union
													and the shift of Labour to a monetarist economic policy,
													way to the Right of where Heath and the Conservatives were
													in the 1970's, has marginalised the Left from the supposed
													accepted narrative. It was inevitable that the Soviet
													Union, a state monolith rather than fluid socialism, should
													bring discredit with its record of oppression. But the
													global balance of power existing when the USSR was a global
													power meant that at least some genuinely socialist
													movements seeking freedom against Western colonisation got
													help instead of just being wiped out. That no longer holds,
													and now in sundry parts of the world the young see only
													fundamentalist Islam as a viable opposition presenting a
													native alternative to Western power and culture. That's a
													pity. Sorry if this is beginning to sound a bit lecturish
													one of the reasons I never could join a party was because
													of their awful monologues about hegemony and words like
													that which would have me glassy-eyed if not asleep.</p>
												<p>The other within the West has been the fragmentation
													of mass-industrial movements with criticism that those
													movements that had spoken most volubly about class
													difference had in fact been riddled with sexism,
													homophobia, racism and other things bound up with narrow
													self-serving patriarchy. A lot of this criticism was
													justified, and remains so. The fallout from this is though
													that we are at a stage and have been for some time where
													any leftwing criticism or serious economic analyis will be
													dismissed in sundry quarters as &ldquo;macho
													posturing&rdquo; etc. New Labour is not alone in
													contemporary "socialist" parliamentary parties as
													apparently trying to get streetcred, or quota points, by
													maintaining that any black blind gay woman will be
													especially welcome&mdash;so long, that is, as they are not
													leftwing.</p>
												<p>I&rsquo;m not even hugely interested in &ldquo;the
													class issue&rdquo; myself to be honest. As long as I am
													true to my own roots and don&rsquo;t abandon them I think I
													will stay ok. I won't betray the culture I come from,
													unlike the present parliamentarians who, like me having
													received free university education, now go to great lengths
													to point out how patently commensical it is that only loans
													can be given. In other words, they are happy to kick away
													the ladder they climbed up.</p>
												<p>I do tend to see Britain as containing a population
													wherein the lower classes still have, in global terms, a
													higher standard of living compared with the average in many
													other parts of the world. The country is still largely
													existing on the residual benefits of its empire days, and
													cheap imports are continuing to keep for the moment things
													under control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Sorry I won&rsquo;t be coming down to Cambridge. I
													will have another go at the final instalment of your
													questions in a wee while.</p>

												<p>Dear Sandy [Hutchinson]</p>
												<p>Thanks for what you sent. I am sitting up and bed
													typing this on my laptop as I have one of my regular winter
													chest infections; otherwise I would have sent you a letter
													to your home address.</p>
												<p>
													It is interesting to see the letter from William Sharp. I
													knew all the details, I have them in my <em><i>Places
															of the Mind </i></em>book sourced from other letters of people who
													were there. There is a longish account of the whole episode
													when Thomson took ill in Marston's flat with Sharp in
													attendance. (<em><i>Places of the Mind</i></em> p 301 et
													seq) The Marston sonnet referred to is quite a good one, I
													used that in my book too.
												</p>
												<p>I never felt warmth towards Sharp. Thomson on his
													deathbed tapped him for a shilling in hospital, at least
													asked him for one. But Sharp only visited Thomson because
													he happened to be in Marston's flat at the same time and
													had helped him to hospital as no one else in the flat was
													capable of doing so. And a malicious rumour that BV was the
													illegitimate son of Bulwer-Lytton was attributed to Sharp's
													disinclination to believe that he was the son of "an
													obscure ship's captain". I don't have the source to hand,
													it may be in my manuscripts in Glasgow University Library.
													It took me real research to disprove the feasibility of
													this nonsense which would have made BV turn in his grave. I
													thought it a poor show that this purveyor of so much
													middle-class wankery could only contribute a smear to the
													memory of a poet worth a thousand times more than himself
													in quality.</p>
												<p>
													Sharp did indeed make it into <em><i>Radical
															Renfrew</i></em> where you can find him on page 340 et seq. I
													could never be bothered with his Celtic Mist nonsense, but
													I did find two fine imagist poems, or one could call them
													that, which he wrote early under his own name. [<em><i>He
															later wrote Celtic fin-de-siecle works under the
															pseudonym Fiona MacLeod.</i></em>] As I say in my biographical
													introduction to him, his main contribution to literature
													(in my opinion) was as editor of the fine series Canterbury
													Poets, a number of which I have obtained in secondhand
													shops and which can contain interesting selections.
												</p>
												<p>
													Such an opinion would not please fans of Sharp which may
													include yourself. Fans in Paisley would include those
													belonging to his fan club the Wilfion Society, which
													published a small paperback of Sharp's poems. The poems
													were supposed to have been written by Sharp after he had
													died, and then communicated to a medium. I would have loved
													to have included some poems written posthumously by a
													contributor to <em><i>Radical Renfrew</i></em>, but
													unfortunately I deemed that death had not improved his
													creative abilities.
												</p>
												<p>Thanks very much for &ldquo;Setting the Time
													Aside&rdquo;. You capture Graham's pace and sober candour
													uncannily; the only sections I am not so sure of are
													sections six and seven, where the focus and the voice seems
													to move away from Sydney's larynx and towards the personal
													narrator. But anyway despite my cavil there I think it's
													impressive the way you have captured delivering an address
													to the man without making it sound like parody.</p>
												<p>I hope this email address for you is still working.</p>
												<p>best wishes</p>

													Subject: <em><i>Sky Blue Notebook</i></em>
												</p>
												<p>Dear Jayne [Wilding]</p>
												<p>What a lovely book, and with such terrific poems in
													it. Gosh that has cheered me up, I'm sitting up in bed here
													with a lingering chest infection.</p>
												<p>So rarely do I come on a poetry book, especially a
													Scottish or British poetry book, where I feel immediately
													at home in the prosody, where I do not feel somewhere at
													the back of my mind that I am doing a good deed for the day
													or "making an effort" in foreign territory. Well, yours is
													foreign territory subject-wise; but I feel so much at home
													in the eyes of the narrative pericipient, and in the lovely
													sparseness but exactness of the diction. What a terrific
													surprise.</p>
												<p>I hope Alan Spence reads it amongst sundry others.
													Obviously you have philosophical mutual points of contact
													and Alan's haiku can connect with your own. But you do much
													more than haiku: I love the two facing poems the Pyrenees/
													roll out below us, and at dusk/ we walk back down. Also
													transformed / by a night made of snow and the "blue sound"
													of that mountain lake. And the closing ten pages are
													tremendous.</p>
												<p>At last, someone who knows how really to use lower
													case and the precise articulated split of the line.</p>
												<p>... many thanks for sending it. You should make sure
													a copy goes into the Calum McDonald pamphlet prize
													competition for 2009, though I doubt the quality of the
													prosody might be over the judges' heads.</p>
												<p>
													[<em><i>I was subsequently told a judge did indeed
															ask why was there &ldquo;no punctuation&rdquo;</i></em>]
												</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Friday January 23rd &rsquo;09</p>
												<p>.....I&rsquo;ve just looked back at my emails to see
													what was the phrase that intrigued you, I think it must
													have been my saying how pleased I was to find someone who
													really knew how to use lower case and &ldquo;the precise
													articulated split of the line&rdquo;.</p>
												<p>Difficult to say precisely just now what I mean,
													I&rsquo;m very tired having been doing things all day and
													am writing this before I go to bed. ...For me as I
													sometimes try to clarify to students when asked, I speak of
													the basis of poetry as the line, the basis of prose the
													paragraph&mdash;though of course nothing is so clearly
													hard-edged and there are umpteen exceptions. But
													that&rsquo;s a reasonable basis. The line, again, can be a
													unit of semantic yield (meaning) a unit of breath
													(articulation) a unit of measure (number of syllables or
													stresses, formal structure). The lowercase tradition that I
													lean towards can combine both that unit of meaning (or
													partial meaning-unit released) and breath in one, occurring
													in the space which allows a double function, the visual
													space as place of eye-kinesis or movement, the visual space
													as occasion of breath or wordpause. The space is a place in
													which the words occur.</p>
												<p>That&rsquo;s as far as I can go just now. Will pick
													this up in further emails, and send you my new essay which
													is not all that good but has a few sentences I like,
													it&rsquo;s a time-line as much as anything.</p>
												<p>Bye for now.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>

												<p>July 31, 2010</p>
												<p>Dear E</p>
												<p>Just to say that that translation of Brecht I have
													sent you I have now revised the first verse to read</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<img
														src="http://tomleonard.co.uk/images/brecht-song-for-all-the-talk.jpg"
														alt="mother courage song for all the talk" />
												</p>
												<p>The literal German of the last line reads "Instead of
													with cheese it is with lead", insofar as one can take a
													literal translation across. The problem with translating
													rhyme always throws up a lot of specific problems as to how
													far one posits a parallel figure of speech at best to catch
													rhyme. One often sees dire rhymed translations if the
													translator has no poetry in them. I in my first or previous
													attempt that I sent you had been picking up on the opening
													scene in which Mother Courage sings of selling boots on her
													waggon; but on reflection I had gone against the meaning by
													missing out the "lead" element as being the important one
													here.</p>
												<p>Anyway you said you wanted to talk about translation
													with me, I'll be happy to do that though to be honest I
													just attack the proceedings by instinct and I hope
													intelligence, you get something felicitous which you are
													pleased with then perhaps, as has just happened with me,
													one has to alter it if the felicity is not appropriate to
													the central burden of the author's intention&mdash;as you
													try to surmise that intention in the language. I'm really
													enjoying this though, I hope you get some of this kind of
													pleasure with Beckett, and I'll certainly be glad to
													dialogue with you if you were working on it.</p>
												<p>all the best</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>

												<p>
													May 3<sup>rd</sup> 2010
												</p>
												<p>Dear N</p>
												<p>I was glad to be back home. There was plane trouble
													at the airport so a long dreary delay at Newquay on hard
													seats made so that people would not sit too long on them
													but move on once they had finished their machine-delivered
													tea.</p>
												<p>An intriguing two days. Being by the edge of a sea
													which meant as much to me because I had been there with my
													children 25 years ago. The reading itself was ok, ok in
													that I was present with my poems when I was allowed to be,
													in the second half. So I could be with nora as I could be
													with the sea. There were a few people there who knew what
													was going on, or that something was going on. But too much
													the Art Club, which is what after all it is called. The one
													in Glasgow is even worse. Of course I am a challenge to
													these places, or rather somebody being in art is a
													challenge, perhaps even, put simply, art itself is a
													challenge. Art of any troubling kind, which is the kind St
													Ives very definitely does not want to hear about, like most
													upmarket seaside places of that type with artists wanting
													to get away from being troubled, to forget about "the
													world" and live sorting out their abstracts and god knows
													what in a Pretty, Changing World. The one thing which
													people can be sure of going somewhere like the Tate is that
													they will not be troubled. There is even a category for the
													"controversial" which is to say the Tracy Ermins etc.</p>
												<p>Bob is great. The only art that can survive
													communally in this kind of place is through somebody like
													him; of the kind that Winnicott meant when he said It is
													play that is the universal. But you don't go to the seaside
													to have a journey within. People there are going to a
													moored cruise ship instead.</p>
												<p>The Viennese woman was interesting, some of her
													poems. But so fucking rude. She came "to collect me" from
													the place without breakfast, and kept time after time
													walking ahead of me then stopping looking up sideways while
													I caught up, like a dog. She stood there as if waiting on
													the fucking dog to catch up. Because I had been to Vienna I
													wanted to talk to her about Ruhm and Jandl. What was
													amusing was that she said she always wanted to get away
													from Vienna to England where she thought the people were
													wonderful. She is somebody again who has "fallen in love
													with the place" St Ives. But she wanted to get away from
													Vienna because it troubled her there; and I felt instantly
													at home in Vienna, daft though that can sound. A similarity
													of architecture to Glasgow, another northern European city.
													She had been taken with what I was doing last night, I
													could see that. But there was no room for comfort.</p>
												<p>.......The most interesting person I met was --'s
													son. Open and searching, and troubled in the right way. Not
													going about or joining a community to be "open and
													searching"; he had thought he was, by doing creative
													writing at some university. But it has displeased him, and
													for the right reasons. I don't know what he will do with
													himself, but at least he has not stopped being himself in
													order to find out. He has not taken the option of the
													professional searcher. So much can be gained just from eye
													contact. The little bit that is silent says so much in the
													midst of all the St Ives talk talk talk.</p>
												<p>..... My mind is never far from Mother Courage which
													I am working on now. Am really enjoying it, Brecht's anger
													and humour and insight into that always present and always
													hidden narrative, the arms trade. At last a vehicle,
													literally, to foreground it.</p>
												<p>ps</p>
												<p>To finish about St Ives. Have had a bit of migraine
													since returning.</p>
												<p>When finally alone in Newquay Airport facing a long
													delay, a horrible raw wave of depression engulfed me of a
													type I have not experienced for years. Very physical. Just
													had to hang on.</p>
												<p>It lifted on the plane when I listened on my ipod to
													some Irish pipe music I happened to have by a piper called
													Willie Clancy. I love the slow air played on the Irish
													pipes. As I love the Scottish pibroch lament, in a
													different, almost Bach related way, that logic and emotion.
													The Clancy brought me back into an art in the world of
													ordinary people like my dad. Which is to say the
													extraordinary.</p>
												<p>Of course there will be really good art in the Tate
													building there, and I like Hepworth for instance. People of
													integrity. But it felt like a temple of the culture
													industry, a horrible looking temple hidden high on the
													hill. Maybe Black people and tin miners should climb the
													ascending wheelramp on their knees. Not that I saw any
													Black people in St Ives.</p>
												<p>P---, who went out of her way for me and was very
													helpful, spoke of doing a map of the Cornwall repossessions
													to fight the tourist crap. She said someone had already
													done that somewhere else. I said to her, maybe it still
													needs to be done here. Or some such. She knew I think what
													I was feeling. P----- and some friends she had at the
													gallery were warm and outgoing.</p>
												<p>What got me about the Art Club reading, looking back,
													was how it was set up: not as a workshop, but as a kind of
													intimate restaurant with everyone given a nice bottle of
													wine and a glass on their table. It was a setting that I
													think exemplifies much of what passes for poetry on the
													BBC: half afterdinner speech, half nice cheese that goes
													with the biscuits. That's why the stiffnecked character in
													the front row under my chin (who never spoke to his wife
													the whole evening) murmured a snide putdown about my poem
													for Lucy and Stephen. I was "getting a bit serious" in the
													wrong way, ie the detail of ordinary life way. That's why I
													told him to fuck off, and was really left on my own, with
													my poems. If you do not open up, what is the point? But
													that is the most subversive thing of all, to open up. That
													is why the whole "educational" structure in relation to
													poetry is about closing down, shutting the door of category
													in anticipation to anything that might at all open up, to
													what is beside you and through you, and of which you might
													assume the right of dignity in itself. I just cannot deal
													with these people. I never could, never will, but long ago
													I realised that what used to worry me as an incapacity I
													recognised as a strength. It had been handed down to me by
													people who would be shut from the doors of the temple on
													the hill&mdash;but who probably built it.</p>
												<p>Bob would get beyond the wine and cheese because he
													probably has in mind a kind of jazz club. He is like George
													Melly, I felt as soon as I saw him, and instantly liked him
													very much. Fuck you to the behaviour pattern, he has in his
													eyes. Anyway. Enough of my rambling, for which forgive me.
													I wanted to get this out to get back seriously to my
													Brecht. But my rumbling headache persists. It is a
													nuisance. Regarding what I said about your own
													performances, I hope you are not in the huff. Your
													performance at the Arnolfini was the best I have seen you
													do, and it was there that a kind of erotic sensuality came
													over in the sort of waves of words....</p>
