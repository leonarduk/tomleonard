													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Monday January
														22nd &lsquo;96</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear C</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">I like the essay
														which I&rsquo;ve read a couple of times: it does make good
														connections in relation to projection and introjection I
														think, and it is good for my ignorance to see a summary of
														the child-development positions laid out. To what extent
														there is a material connection between the personal and
														the institutional, and especially the national, concept,
														is something I want to consider longer. The models of
														psychogical individual development do seem to offer ways
														of examining what can be seen as insititutional or
														national behaviour, but I am uncertain of the bridge being
														other than metaphoric - in the way that mechanics and
														engineering are so often the basis for description of
														medical or physiological process. Maybe it can be
														precisely traced to the behaviour of individuals within
														the larger group: I only baulk at any model which in its
														own albeit heterogenious and multi-faceted way, might
														proceed by analogy to concretise a &ldquo;we&rdquo;,
														especially if suggested that that &ldquo;we&rdquo; is
														other than the accident of territory. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Perhaps I am
														straying off the path of your argument. Another reading,
														and preferably a good discussion sometime, will be
														welcome. About my own poems. The tea-time one I see as
														being an ironic thing about certain male-female positions
														in the West of Scotland, not themselves touching on
														religion. In fact it was yourself who alerted me to some
														of the basic ironies in the poem, years ago, that I
														hadn&rsquo;t fully articulated to myself. The
														dependent/independent thing as discussed in &ldquo;My Name
														is Tom&rdquo; would I think be more accurately defined
														within the dependent/counterdependent poles of the Burns
														Conceptual Poem, Intimate Voices p 123. I can&rsquo;t
														remember which analyst I read who gave me the
														&ldquo;counterdependent&rdquo; but I think dependence
														versus counterdependence more accurately describes the
														reaction formation into which the two halves have locked.
														Certainly (I suppose my Celtic-Rangers joke about Oedipus
														screwing his mother at both ends applies) a concomitant
														form of maturity would be required before a sense of
														independence could be achieved. In that I see, I think, a
														way of agreeing with the focus of your argument, as with
														the learning and accepting of differences - which I via
														Radical Renfrew tend to think of as a kind of
														structuralist dynamic of opposites. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyway Colin I
														will not rabbit on. I enclose a spare copy of a Lines
														Review from last year which had some of my new poems in
														it. You don&rsquo;t need to find time to read them let
														alone comment upon them until whenever. But don&rsquo;t
														put off contacting again &ldquo;until you&rsquo;ve read
														them&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the sort of thing I do, and
														you&rsquo;re not supposed to do it at all. I do add a
														strange wee almost prayer-like poem I wrote around the
														beginning of December, which calmed me down when I was
														feeling a bit uptight. Hope we&rsquo;re in contact again
														soon.</span>

												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Sunday March 3rd
														&lsquo;96</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear T</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Thanks for the
														magazine. I&rsquo;ll order the book itself locally in a
														bookshop. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">The article does
														not contain the phrase which made me prick up my ears when
														used in the talk, which was something in respect of male
														&ldquo;ontology&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m engaged in writing a
														long article about Crichton Smith, Edwin Morgan, W.S.
														Graham - for <em>PN Review</em>, ironically enough.
														Ontology comes into it, though mainly in respect of
														Graham&rsquo;s structured relationship between author and
														reader, which I think of in terms of a kind of
														&ldquo;transformational ontology&rdquo;. The word has had
														particular significance for myself since coming on
														&ldquo;ontological security&rdquo; in RD Laing&rsquo;s <em>The
															Divided Self</em> of the mid-sixties. In my own mind though it
														has a kind of relationship with Duns Scotus&rsquo;s
														haeccitas. The nature of the Present Tense.
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Where
														people&rsquo;s ontologies seem to being criticised in the
														plural therefore I want to get a stethoscope out and have
														a listen to the health of the language being used. I know
														about the argument that if the unconscious is structured
														like a language, and the language is rotten, then you have
														people limited by rotten (un)consciousnesses. But those be
														dangerous waters of collective dehumanisation sailed of
														course by every imperialist since colonisation began, and
														not to be unmuddied by a reaction formation. At any rate I
														want to see the precise text of the lecture. Her poetry in
														translation - I can&rsquo;t read Irish - such as
														Heaney&rsquo;s translation &ldquo;Miracle Grass&rdquo;, I
														think wonderful. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Enclosed is a
														spare copy of the <em>Lines Review</em> in which I had
														some poems last autumn. It was good last year to be
														writing poetry again after a gap of a few years where my
														writing seemed to go into other shapes. In respect of the
														shaping, I love Carol Rumens definition of the essence of
														a poem as &ldquo;silence used as a major part of a
														rhythmic structure&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s as near to the
														heart of it as I&rsquo;ve seen in print. Also, that the
														gender of the poets from whom you learn is &ldquo;not
														nearly as important as how they use the word
														&ldquo;and&rdquo;, or whether they put a comma between two
														adjectives.&rdquo;

												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear S <br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Thanks for the
														card, and your letter. I have thought of you and C a
														number of times, though as usual I am not very productive
														in the epistolary department. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Just now I wish I
														was more productive in the sense of getting some paid
														work, but that is not happening. The business of even
														signing on to get unemployment benefit is difficult under
														this wonderful government as who knows I might get a
														secret reading next week, or the week after, and obviously
														this would have tremendous repercussions on The Taxpayer,
														not to mention the Public Spending Borrowing Requirement,
														if persons of my persuasion were to get away with things.
														Still I am getting by alright in that area, enough of
														moaning. But this fucking government: they are now in the
														process of destroying the beef industry with their stupid
														deregulation of safety measures to please their pals in
														the feedstuff business; and yet they openly talk as if the
														main commensical question is whether slaughtering infected
														cattle on a large scale is feasible when it would have the
														effect of making the chancellor unable to give the
														promised tax cuts necessary before the next general
														election. They really are a bunch of corrupt bastards.
														Manufacturing here is being reduced to the status of
														putting together electronic lego kits for Japan, or making
														arms and fighter aeroplanes for Saudi Arabia. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">At the moment I am
														busy putting together a long article - 5,000 words - on
														the poetry of W.S.Graham, Ian Crichton Smith, and Edwin
														Morgan. It is for <em>PN Review</em>, and I will send you
														it when it is done. Thanks for the postcard of the Duns
														Scotus. Your cards are always very sensitive, I&rsquo;m
														really pleased to get the new one. I&rsquo;ll just sign
														off now, enclosing the <em>Lines Review</em> of last
														autumn.

												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Monday April 8th
														&lsquo;96</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear Pauline Brown</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Thanks for your
														letter. I didn&rsquo;t know what you were talking about
														when you made mention of my &ldquo;press release&rdquo;
														until I remembered I had sent you the statement that went
														into the poetry magazine <em>PN Review</em> when they
														asked myself, and about 50 other poets, to send five poems
														with an accompanying statement about the work, for a
														special issue of the magazine. It was not of course a
														press release - I haven&rsquo;t quite yet reached the
														stage of issuing press releases about the contents of my
														poems.
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">To your questions,
														some of which I don&rsquo;t want to tackle as they are
														essentially about other people&rsquo;s work, not my own.
														Which writers for instance have been influenced by my
														poetry is not something that concerns me in the act of
														writing. I have been thanked by some and that has been
														gratifying (when I have admired their work) but that is a
														side issue, nothing to do with my own work itself. Good
														writers like James Kelman and Irving Welsh choose their
														influences, I do not hold to a domino theory of
														Literature. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">James Kelman has
														remarked his admiration for my &ldquo;commitment to the
														voice&rdquo;, which you will have seen quoted on the back
														of my <em>Reports from the Present</em>. But as he
														certainly knows, and intended, that commitment goes right
														throughout my work and is not restricted to the
														&ldquo;obvious&rdquo; voice presence of my Glasgow dialect
														sequences. It is certainly crucial in poems like &ldquo;A
														Priest Came on at Merkland Street&rdquo; and the sequence
														nora&rsquo;s place. The whole politics of literature as a
														model of articulation as distinct from a model of layered
														meaning, and intrinsic value, is still too hot to handle
														in much of contemporary Britain&mdash;certainly in the
														groves of academe that lay claim to &ldquo;teach&rdquo;
														the stuff.
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">The crucial
														existential shift for me in my writing came against the
														background of my reading what can be called an existential
														tradition - Kierkegaard, the Hogg of the <em>Confessions</em>,
														Lermontov, Sartre&rsquo;s<em> nausea</em>, RD Laing &amp;
														numerous others - and the liberation gained from American,
														not British, certainly not Scottish, writers before me. I
														think it was cummings who first brought across to me that
														shift to the page-as-a-thing-itself. My reasons for
														admiring what was going on in America come out as clearly
														as I can make it in my essay on Williams in <em>Intimate
															Voices</em>. That also should answer your question about Eliot
														and the public voice. It relates to the point I make in
														the introduction to <em>Radical Renfrew</em> about the
														standardisation of language transcription in the
														nineteenth century. That again has to do with status of
														language, power, and who owns the Recognised Language that
														Supposedly Contains the World.
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">All this stuff is
														still about language as some kind of detachable thing from
														my work, and influence. That wearies me. I write poems, I
														am a poet, not a poser of linguistic conundra, nor a
														Writer of Scottish Literature. To understand my poems one
														has to understand a remark like Carol Rumens&rsquo;s
														definition of poetry as &ldquo;silence used as a major
														part of a rythmic structure&rdquo;. One would have to know
														Olson&rsquo;s Projective Verse essay, the work of Creeley,
														Williams of course, Zukofsky perhaps. At least, to talk
														intellligently about the work might require a knowledge of
														this, and say Beckett&rsquo;s use of the comma in his
														great postwar prose novels, which knocked me out when I
														read them - aloud when pissed. Language as a model of
														articulation. Not some contribution to Scottish Language
														debates, like a covert letter to the Scotsman. Simply the
														given that Language is universal, though no single
														language is universal: the only universal language is art.
														I write my poems in the language of art. The writing
														includes as having equal weight, the spaces between the
														words and lines. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Why did I compose
														<em>Radical Renfrew</em>? Well, because it was there, as
														they say. The context I did explain in the introduction. I
														was glad when what surfaced, surfaced. It was a kind of
														paying homage to my ancestors, and bringing them back into
														the conversation from which they had been excluded. I just
														wanted to hear what they had to say, and to hell with
														their having to buy a ticket from some canon-holder to see
														if they could be let into the auditorium. I loved it, it
														was a privilege, and when recording some of the poems for
														Radio Scotland in a series based on the book, I brought
														into the studio a photograph of my great-grandparents that
														I had recently been given. It wasn&rsquo;t a sentimental
														act, just a recognition: you don&rsquo;t have to be
														&ldquo;uncivilised&rdquo;&mdash;or maybe you do&mdash;to
														perform the basic rite of honouring your ancestors. These
														things would be obvious in other cultures.
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">About
														&ldquo;postmodernism&rdquo; and whether I see myself as
														such. I think it&rsquo;s a kind of truism that nobody
														knows how to define it, though in fairness much of the
														isms have that kind of aura, including the existentialism
														aforementioned. I mean nothing other than what I say in
														saying that I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself a postmodernist,
														but if anyone wants to call me one, they&rsquo;re welcome
														to it. I have been also called a structuralist, when that
														word was more in vogue. Whether or not the word applies,
														the business of simultaneity and collocation certainly is
														a feature of my work, obviously in something like
														&ldquo;The Present Tense&rdquo;, and also soundpoetry work
														like &ldquo;My Name is Tom&rdquo;, described in the essay
														&ldquo;How I Became a Soundpoet&rdquo;. I see this
														simultaneity as part of my artistic overall style, which I
														would like ideally to constitute a kind of republic of
														voices, grounded on a consistent personality and
														philosophy of language. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">The Thomson book
														is as much a part of that as the others. The publishers
														messed up a crucial factor in printing out full the
														numbers I had entered numerically: this was because the
														central narration is intended as an information-dealing
														voice, that occasionally is pressured by the emotions of
														the &ldquo;author&rdquo;, and is always moving through a
														sea of quoted voices from the material. It reaches its
														furthest point for me in the diary chapter based on random
														numbers, with the use of the word &ldquo;blank&rdquo; when
														there was no diary entry for that date. That was nothing
														to do with postmodern tricksiness, as some thought, and
														was certainly further than the more patriarchal critics
														could go: it stood for me as the point where within the
														structure, the existence of the subject and the narrator
														were given the same weight. The subject could
														&ldquo;escape&rdquo; beyond the narrator&rsquo;s
														definition. RD Laing is the kind of background to my
														thinking and feeling here.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">But that to me is
														no more than what the arrangement of the Glasgow poems in
														sequences is about. The important thing for me about them
														is not whether they&mdash;and &ldquo;Honest&rdquo;&mdash;
														have influenced others: what matters to me is that they
														are &ldquo;mobiles&rdquo;, that the authorial voice is
														implanted on an equal footing with the described. The
														described voice is not presumed as Other, outwith the
														author-reader&rsquo;s. But to me, I repeat, they are
														poems, first and foremost, and last. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">To go back to your
														question about <em>Radical Renfrew</em>. Locality is
														important, I see it, in the way that Lawrence or Williams
														saw it. History through the five senses. <em>Intimate
															Voices</em> is for me a kind of statement that moves out into
														<em>Radical Renfrew</em>, then out again, through the
														person as subject, in <em>Places of the Mind.</em> The
														last poem in <em>nora&rsquo;s place</em> and the first
														poem&mdash; &ldquo;The Good Thief&rdquo;&mdash;in <em>Intimate
															Voices</em> are really two poems about exactly the same thing.
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Grassic Gibbon was
														a storyteller, which I am not. The process he describes in
														his quote is one employed by a story-teller before him
														whom I admire more than Gibbon, namely Galt. The business
														of so-called nonstandard English in my own work I think of
														as having at least as much in kin with a number of
														Caribbean and Afro-English writers as with any Scottish
														writer. It&rsquo;s a pity that when The Late Show did a
														feature after <em>Reports from the Present </em>came out,
														they among other contributions about my work left a 15
														minute interview with Linton Kwesi Johnston on the cutting
														room floor. But that&rsquo;s politics. And locating the
														history of that politics you can go back at least to
														Wordsworth v Coleridge in the Preface to the <em>Lyrical
															Ballads</em> and Coleridge&rsquo;s reply, Clare&rsquo;s
														statements about grammar and use of same, Burns&rsquo;s
														lowering of Milton&rsquo;s register in the Address to the
														De&rsquo;il. Thence to America for a while. It&rsquo;s
														about status of language and not simply art, but status
														and worth of people&rsquo;s individual separate
														existences. The stooshie over <em>How Late it Was </em>winning
														the Booker was simply because some found it hard to
														swallow that a high-status award was given to a work in
														what was seen as low-status language. When you refer to
														&ldquo;the use of swearing&rdquo;, ok Six Glasgow Poems is
														about 1967/68, <em>Ghostie Men</em>, which really goes
														into the register there, 1979. But &ldquo;Cuntbittin
														crawdoun Kennedy, coward of kind&rdquo; is from somewhere
														between 1490 and whenever Dunbar wrote &ldquo;The
														Flyting&rdquo; before his death. From the beginning of
														what&rsquo;s recognised as modern literature, in other
														words.
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Hope the above is
														of some use. I envy you being in Barcelona, though the
														temperature here has at long last crawled into double
														figures. <br />

												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;Dear Chloe
														Gill</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Thanks for your

														me on the machine.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">1&nbsp;&nbsp;
														It&rsquo;s difficult for me to say what my picture of
														Glasgow was then, as I never really have a coherent
														picture anyway. It&rsquo;s just the place I live in, and I
														consciously resist attempts that have been quite evident
														since the early eighties, to market it in different ways
														as a single-aspect high-status cultural object. This to my
														way of seeing things is simply a product of the prevailing
														monetarist culture of civic underfunding, which sees
														district councillors adopting the strategy of projecting
														themselves as Management Teams, aiming to attract revenue
														from tourists or external sources now known as
														&ldquo;customers&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all anathema to me
														I&rsquo;m afraid, no doubt the planned giant needle in St
														Enoch&rsquo;s Square will be the required new City Logo
														(like the Gateshead Angel) and the city coat of arms will
														one day be supplemented with a mission statement. Like
														Edinburgh and Liverpool supposedly &ldquo;competing&rdquo;
														with Glasgow for the City of Architecture award, and
														&ldquo;we&rdquo; supposed to be going to work with a
														spring in our step next day etc. when Glasgow got it.
														False notions of &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; and a kind of bogus
														local nationalism are part of the Public Relations/
														marketing hot air essential to it all. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1982 my family
														and myself had been decanted, to use the horrible metaphor
														(I prefer uprooted) while our house was being saved from
														falling down. Where we stay, and to where we returned
														about 1984, I like, as it&rsquo;s a mixed studentish area
														facing a park. We&rsquo;re very lucky. Lots of people in
														Glasgow are likewise or in different ways very lucky. Lots
														aren&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a city. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; To
														be honest I haven&rsquo;t a clue. If my memory serves me
														right there was subsequently a concern about financial
														shenanigans over the sale of the land in connection with
														the festival, but I have long since forgotten what all
														that was about. My only memory of the festival - I never
														visited the site - is seeing on TV Prince Charles trying
														to win natives&rsquo; favour by reciting some
														jeallie-piece nonsense at the opening. His accent was
														memorable: I think he pronounced &ldquo;jammy scone&rdquo;
														as &ldquo;jammy skoon&rdquo;. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;
														It&rsquo;s so difficult to separate jaunty newspaper stuff
														from actualities. The &ldquo;public&rdquo; is a concept
														anyway that is being replaced with &ldquo;the
														customers&rdquo;, see above. As a writer I feel glad about
														a deal of the things that have been going on in writing in
														Glasgow, but none of them are concerned with improving the
														city&rsquo;s &ldquo;image&rdquo; for tourists. Or does
														&ldquo;the public&rsquo;s view of Glasgow&rdquo; mean the
														citizens&rsquo;? People like to think that others like
														them, and part of the drive, if for electoral as well as
														other reasons, has been to persuade citizens that tourists
														think their place is great. This has had to have been
														driven on despite enforced massive cuts in the rate
														support grant, ratecapping, and therefore onward cuts in
														civic funding. That is the nub that can&rsquo;t be got
														away from. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">But on the
														positive side, speaking as a citizen, the sandstone
														cleaning has done a lot to brighten the tenements up,
														there&rsquo;s no question of that. There&rsquo;s a
														generation growing up now to whom you would have to show
														photographs of the streets of blackened tenements
														everywhere for them to have a clue what the place actually
														used to look like not long ago. The cleaned buildings
														definitely lightens the spirit for people like me who live
														in such a sandstone tenement area.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
														think I&rsquo;ve probably answered this one as far as I
														can, when trying to work out answer three. Glasgow is like
														many former heavy industry manufacturing cities with no
														heavy industry anymore: there&rsquo;s real problems about
														jobs. It&rsquo;s in some ways simple as that I see it, in
														some ways complex. To what extent (and you can say this
														about much of Eastern Europe) are over-45 working class
														males to be flushed down the lav as having had their
														useful day; to what extent must working-class women and
														young people be brought on board a low-security,
														short-term-contract &ldquo;service&rdquo; culture with
														talk about &lsquo;training&rdquo;, &ldquo;equality&rdquo;,
														&ldquo;no more dinosaur union tactics&rdquo; etc -
														basically to provide the work base for a low wage free
														market economy? I do think unemployment and the effects of
														poverty have been heavily masked by the fact that Britain
														is still the tail-end of empire, and the destruction of
														the seamen&rsquo;s unions has meant that cheap clothes and
														stuff have been able to come in from abroad. But again
														there&rsquo;s complexities there too: you get areas of
														comparitively poor families where nonetheless
														there&rsquo;s this kind of label-culture dependency, with
														kids who wear thin tee-shirts on cold days nonetheless
														getting some expensive label leather jacket, when
														that&rsquo;s the peergroup thing. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">I don&rsquo;t
														know, and won&rsquo;t pretend to know what the future is
														here. I&rsquo;m lucky to be staying where I am, and I can
														see ok for the next couple of months, which is how I think
														a lot of people get by. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
														you&rsquo;re still referring to the Garden Festival I
														don&rsquo;t know. I hope a lot of people had a good day
														out. It has been ironic that the council has on the other
														hand made sundry efforts since to commercialise bits of
														the city parks, which always annoys me, and I have been
														involved in more than one campaign to stop them turning
														Kelvingrove Park into either a three storey entertainment
														complex or a huge Gallery of Scottish Art. Thankfully both
														these have been beaten off so far, though the latest plan
														is to uproot lots of it to drive &ldquo;a light railway
														system&rdquo; through. The battle continues. All the best.

												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">I trust you both
														enjoyed Ireland. Pity the weather isn&rsquo;t a bit
														warmer, I do feel sorry for some of the tourists in
														Glasgow just now, today seems colder than ever, about 10
														degrees, raining and a bloody cold wind. But it
														wasn&rsquo;t so bad overall when you were across the water
														I think.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Enclosed is a
														piece I wrote for the STUC magazine about the small
														library in TUC headquarters down here. The piece is not in
														any sense a lively piece of writing, merely an inventory
														of some of the things in their collection. But I wanted to
														draw the existence of the library to the attention of the
														many who know nothing about it, so I thought a kind of
														listed sampler would raise people&rsquo;s awareness and
														perhaps curiosity to investigate further. The editors
														chose the title (I had &ldquo;Keeping the Red Flag
														Flying&rdquo; - perhaps a bit extreme in these New Britain
														days when the flag is supposed to be in the
														Dinosaurs&rsquo; Department at the Party Museum) and I
														suggested that &ldquo;socialist activist&rdquo; might be a
														bit farfetched, some unsympathetic acquaintances might
														rather see me described as a hard-left couch potato. But
														they printed what they chose, so there it is.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">In recent weeks I
														have been working towards a small exhibition of texts I
														was asked to do along with some other writers and artists
														in the Pearce Institute in Govan, really a local community
														centre now. The space chosen for my own pieces was the
														restaurant, a pie &amp; beans, fish &amp; chips place
														really. I had a laugh drawing these things up,
														they&rsquo;ll be enlarged in the same font and put
														directly on the walls.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Also enclosed is a
														tape purchased for &pound;1 from Bargain Books, Clemens
														Krauss conducting the Strauss family. I always thought his
														Strauss was superb, it was played often to me by a friend
														when the performances were on Ace of Clubs in the early
														sixties. The recordings here and there show their age, but
														are well worth belting out when some lifting of spirits is
														required. </span>

												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Thank you for your

														of flu messed up my schedule for things, which got left
														behind.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">It had actually
														occurred to me looking through my BBC work for the year
														that perhaps you did in fact use for The Afternoon Shift
														the recording I had made myself for another programme.
														I&rsquo;m glad to learn that that was the case, and I have
														no objection to your having done that.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">The reason I was
														so alarmed at first is simply that I have had some really
														awful experiences of people using my dialect poems and
														assuming I would not disapprove. In fact without exception
														even the best-intentioned actor/reader has noticeably
														&ldquo;put on a Glasgow voice&rdquo; for the poems - even
														when they have had a natural Glasgow accent of their own
														to begin with. The results have been the exact opposite of
														what the poems intend. That&rsquo;s why, however
														hypersensitive it might be thought, I&rsquo;ve just had to
														really make an absolute rule - only myself gets reading
														them on the radio and tv.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyway it&rsquo;s
														been cleared up satisfactorily this time. Thanks again for
														writing. </span>

												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear S </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Here is the
														sequence newly finished that I told you about on the
														phone. It is largely extracted from a lot of material
														tidied up that I wrote for a performance one man stage
														work I was commissioned to do for the Third Eye centre a
														few years ago. Also there were some poems written in a
														notebook that otherwise contains BV Thomson material.
														It&rsquo;s a good job I rescued it as in a few weeks the
														notebook and all my other Thomson workings are going to
														the Glasgow University Special Collections Department.
														I&rsquo;ve managed to sell them my Thomson stuff for a
														couple of thousand pounds. Much needed dough as I&rsquo;ve
														nothing much else coming in.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">We enjoyed our
														week away in England, the cliff walks as I mentioned were
														terrific: the Cleveden Way runs I don&rsquo;t know how far
														along the Yorkshire coastline&mdash;a couple of hundred
														miles I think.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">I&rsquo;m off to
														England again next week, this time to teach an Arvon
														creative writing course in Devon, right down at the back
														of beyond. Anne Stevenson will be my fellow tutor, and the
														pupils are some sixth form college. When I&rsquo;ve took
														an Arvon before the students have been adult, so this will
														be a bit different. Kathleen Jamie should have been the
														tutor along with me, but she had to call off as it was
														going to be difficult with her new baby. The train journey
														from Glasgow itself is seven and a half hours, plus a long
														lift by car at the end. She would have been coming down
														from Fife. Anne Stevenson and I come from very different
														poetry bases, but I used to know her when she was in
														Glasgow (living with Philip Hobsbaum in the seventies) and
														she is fine to get along with. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Don&rsquo;t worry
														about writing for a while, you told me you&rsquo;re busy
														and anyway usually it&rsquo;s been yourself sending long
														letters into a Scottish silence. Hope you like the
														sequence: I&rsquo;m quite happy about it, haven&rsquo;t
														decided yet whether to try to get it published separately
														as a booklet, which I do think I&rsquo;d quite like, or
														with my other new stuff of this past couple of years. I
														add a few of the poem phrases that you might otherwise
														have difficulty with.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">All the best to C
														and yourself. Next time you are coming to Scotland
														don&rsquo;t worry about looking for a place to stay this
														time, assume you can stay at Eldon Street, you will both
														be very welcome. </span>

														17th &lsquo;96 <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear Anne <br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">At last writing to
														thank you for your letter and book&mdash;it has been
														ignorant of me not to have got back to you before now.
														There was a flu, there was the busiest three weeks
														I&rsquo;ve had this past two years (doing readings with
														Edward Dorn and running another non-Arvon creative writing
														thing) but really it was that I hadn&rsquo;t got down to
														reading your biography of Plath and wanted to do so before
														writing. I&rsquo;ve read it now, an important book it is
														of course, compulsive to read, and I&rsquo;m glad you put
														it my way. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">It&rsquo;s set me
														thinking about the nature of this writing beastie and what
														way it grabs our throats or ankles. The Plath of two
														opposing selves seems a convincing presentation, the
														ontological mess in the spotless kitchen, the girl who had
														to win the Ideal Home competition along with the Great
														Poetry one. A pity great poetry had to be sought in the Id
														and the Ideal Home in the Superego. Or something like
														that. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">And yet.
														I&rsquo;ve never been satisfied with Plath&rsquo;s
														position as it came to me certainly in the late poems.
														There has always seemed to me a complicity being asked, a
														double-bind that indeed as your book brings out gives
														specific and demanding weight to the phrase &ldquo;special
														pleading&rdquo;&mdash;while at the same time taking refuge
														on a ground note reiterating the one phrase: Fuck You. And
														how I hate that Holocaust imagery, as if Auschwitsch can
														be reduced to a purely metaphoric level&mdash;in order to
														be transmuted into the ultimate soapy dish to be hurled at
														the door. It&rsquo;s a kind of parthian, grandly inflated
														particularism that can only be a universal if all daddies
														are basically bastards and crypto-nazis, which of course
														some folk are very happy to believe: they must have been
														very upset indeed by your book. Whaur&rsquo;s yer
														triumphalist victimology noo? <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">The whole social
														area that you deal with I find tremendously interesting,
														that really hardedged competitiveness, the sense of
														striving to be amongst some kind of heritage-elite, makers
														of value in the central narration. It&rsquo;s fascinating
														to me, like watching some kind of queer beehive under
														discussion. And they really believe it. That comes over
														very well: how naff, how absolutely fucking naff, to move
														into Yeats&rsquo;s house. Gradus ad Parnassum. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">And yet, again.
														Plath comes out quite sympathetically, as sympathetically
														at any rate as the credible, and the quotes from her,
														especially I thought in the prose, just flare up in the
														page as damned good writing. Which is the point. I think
														what our biographies share is a decision to make the
														author responsible as a person in relation to the subject.
														In mine it is largely implicit until the end, in yours it
														is explicit. We do it from different poles but it is
														there. They&rsquo;re both books by poets about poets,
														people as beings in the world resolving their position
														with another late member of the family. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">-----</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m
														sorry I&rsquo;ve taken this time to get back. It&rsquo;s
														now the 27th, and half six in the morning. I decided to
														get out the bed this time, instead of lying looking at the
														ceiling, wondering where the hell the Boat of Life is
														going now. The trouble with being married sometimes is
														it&rsquo;s too comfortable, the bed&rsquo;s too warm and
														you tell yourself you don&rsquo;t want to wake your
														partner by making a noise getting up. And you can&rsquo;t
														put the light on to read. Maybe it&rsquo;s just central
														heating we need. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Which makes me
														think, again about your book. How much competitiveness
														there must have been between Hughes and Plath; I just
														don&rsquo;t believe it wasn&rsquo;t there under the
														surface, and a crucial feed-in to the last outburst. But
														the myth of its absence must have been wonderful: the
														whole Yaddo episode reads as an idyll of becoming, I
														really enjoyed that, and of course it has its structural
														place in the story. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">For another story
														I happen to have read recently about an artist, I
														recommend very strongly The Early Life of James MacBey.
														It&rsquo;s a short posthumous memoir in the recently
														remaindered Canongate Classics, and is a remarkable book
														describing the childhood and coming of age of an etcher in
														a grim anti-artistic Aberdeenshire culture at the turn of
														the century. Alasdair Gray read it and bought half a dozen
														for friends. I can well see why and will send you one if I
														come on another. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Thanks also for
														Four and a Half Dancing Men. It&rsquo;s strange reading it
														how one of the first people to come to my mind was me old
														friend Williams, whom I normally don&rsquo;t bracket with
														your own prosody. But Salter&rsquo;s Gate took me right
														away to that road to the contagious hospital, the rhythm,
														the &ldquo;pointing out /come discovery&rdquo; of clear
														visual specifics in an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; location, as
														revealing somehow the meaning of the place, located out of
														the way of places-supposedly-having-meaning. So American,
														Puritan maybe, like the wonderful Hopper watercolours I
														could have taken off the wall and ate at an exhibition
														last summer in the National Gallery in Edinburgh. Of
														course not exclusively American. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">How Brueghel
														attracts the poets, almost to a point of their own
														definition as artists sometimes, or to some reflection on
														aesthetics in relation to the real world. Your own
														Brueghel poem I like the way it connects with one of the
														book&rsquo;s carrying subtexts, it seems to me, about the
														creative act: in relation to which the image of the title
														poem of the collection is beautiful when discovered in the
														poem itself. It takes me, the child in the bed with the
														valley of the blanket from the knees, not only back to my
														own childhood as one of those &ldquo;basic images&rdquo;,
														but to Winnicott, whose writing on creativity I find very
														exciting: it is Winnicott&rsquo;s &ldquo;potential
														space&rdquo;, where in creativity the &ldquo;transitional
														object&rdquo; is for the child &ldquo;the root of
														symbolism in time&rdquo;. Do you know Winnicott&rsquo;s
														Playing and Reality? &ldquo;It is in playing and only in
														playing that the individual child or adult is able to be
														creative and to use the whole personality, and it is only
														in being creative that the individual discovers the
														self.&rdquo; <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyway there is a
														great deal in your own collection that I admire and enjoy
														very much. Thanks. Here&rsquo;s a copy of Radical Renfrew
														for you to enjoy some of at any rate I hope, perhaps to
														argue with some too. Marion Bernstein and Edward Polin are
														amongst those I think worth a first look, though poets
														like Inspector Aitken (that&rsquo;s right) show a lot of
														skill and feeling in something like &ldquo;After the
														Accident&rdquo;. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Don&rsquo;t reply
														if you&rsquo;re too busy, I hardly deserve it. See you
														next year at Arvon.</span>

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;Dear Charles
														<br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Your letter begins
														by saying that you&rsquo;re worried in case you have
														offended me. Charles that is simply not possible and never
														will be possible. I trust your friendship and good wishes
														absolutely and believe me they are entirely reciprocated.
														However I have been remiss lately in fact we both have
														been a bit remiss over this past couple of years in not
														keeping as regular contact as before. A visit from you
														next time in Glasgow would remedy that in the best way. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">I&rsquo;m sending
														a letter rather than phoning as I owe you a letter and
														sometimes a letter&rsquo;s better. We can speak by phone
														tomorrow or the next day. I did phone the day I received
														your CD, for which much thanks, but there was no answer or
														the line was engaged, I think the former. Of course I
														should have kept trying but I did honestly phone once so
														maybe you will let me off with a hundred lines rather than
														six of the belt. Or maybe you&rsquo;re really annoyed and
														will send me The Three Tenors. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Part of the reason
														I&rsquo;ve been behind with things in this past month
														specifically is that the end of October and the beginning
														of November seem to be for some reason, this past few
														years, that period of the year when I am run off my feet
														with readings and other commitments. It must be something
														to do with Winter budgets. Not that I mind earning the
														money at all, but it is strange the way things seem to
														pile up at this time. I&rsquo;m just now at last relaxing
														after a three week period in which besides school
														readings, I was in London one weekend for two readings,
														then cutting in and out of a tour with the American poet
														Ed Dorn which meant readings in Preston and Swansea as
														well as Edinburgh; also a creative writing weekend with
														Kathy Galloway at Wiston Lodge, the YMCA place down past
														Biggar. That last was an absorbing weekend: apart from my
														being reminded how dark darkness is and how silent silence
														is in the country, there was an interesting mix of
														students at Wiston. One half was from a Lanark
														writers&rsquo; group, earnest people, a few quite poash;
														the other half was from groups associated with the
														magazine The Big Issue &mdash;not poash at all, in fact
														tending more to the pissed. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">It was a good
														laugh actually and there was some good work done. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">I needed a rest
														after the back-to-back carry-on of different things. The
														organiser of Ed Dorn&rsquo;s tour had billeted him with me
														for three days as Dorn wanted to see Glasgow. I&rsquo;d
														never met the man in my life&mdash;though I&rsquo;ve
														admired his magnum opus Gunslinger for years&mdash;and
														although he was agreeable company in many ways I found his
														presence, catechising me all the time for what proved to
														be a journal of his visit that he was keeping, to be a
														great strain. Things are a lot quieter again; I&rsquo;ve
														managed to keep my financial end up besides readings by
														among other things selling manuscripts. The Places of the
														Mind manuscripts and related documents, all 62 cardboard
														wallets of it,</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;"> I have sold to
														Glasgow University Library. There&rsquo;s a guide that I
														drew up if you want a copy. I&rsquo;m also selling bits
														and pieces to the National LIbrary though I don&rsquo;t
														expect much dough from that. But bits and bobs keep coming
														along, and it keeps me earning certainly more than I would
														if I was signing on. This morning&rsquo;s post has a
														request for me to do the entries of the new DNB for
														Motherwell and Tannahill.&hellip;</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">I presume you have
														read The Early Life of James McBey which I have just read
														there this weekend. What a wonderful book. I was given it
														by Alasdair Gray who, when he read it having bought it as
														a remaindered Canongate Classic, went back and bought
														another half dozen to give to his friends. It is the kind
														of book that would make you do that. Quite a foil to the
														life of Sylvia Plath which I have also recently read in
														the biography by Anne Stevenson, with whom I did an Arvon
														a couple of months ago. More on this when we talk.</span>

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear Mrs C <br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Thanks for the
														proofs and the letter. Regarding the proofs, there are
														just two things I&rsquo;ve added to Merkland Street: that
														there be a bit more space between the subtitle and the
														text, and that the closing envoi line be indented further
														left than marked on the corrected proof sent. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">In the
														biographical/ interpretative paragraph, I have asked that
														the first sentence be removed. It&rsquo;s not simply a
														difference of interpretation, it&rsquo;s that the sentence
														does not describe what my work is doing and will seriously
														mislead readers of the anthology as to how to approach the
														two poems. My phonetic Glasgow poems have nothing to do
														with satire in the mode itself, rather the accurate
														representation of a diction: satire may in some be used,
														but it is in fact irony that is most likely to occur, in a
														country where accent has such political significance
														hierarchically. As for &ldquo;A Priest Came on at Merkland
														Street&rdquo;, whatever the poem is about it is not about
														&ldquo;satirising the pretence and fraud in
														institutions&rdquo; through phonetics; it may be about
														loneliness, its subtext may be something to do with
														Kierkegaard, and its deliberately banal, low-register
														implicit irony may be about distaste for Big Name bogus
														high-register poems which pretend to write about Europe
														and Western Civilisation breaking down when all that is
														breaking down is the poet&rsquo;s own humdrum self badly
														in need of somebody to touch them and have some sex with
														them. Anyway I don&rsquo;t want that nailed to the mast
														either, but please remove the flag that is
														there&mdash;it&rsquo;s not for my ships. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">The other thing I
														worry about especially in relation to this is the space
														marked &ldquo;artwork&rdquo;. Do I understand by this some
														kind of illustration? If so, then I&rsquo;m sorry but I
														can&rsquo;t give permission for my work to be used until I
														see what the illustration is. I have fallen foul of this
														once before when an English magazine doing a special
														&ldquo;Scottish edition&rdquo; printed facing some poems a
														kiltie dancing arms in the air over a pair of crossed
														fountain pens. I wouldn&rsquo;t expect OUP to go in for
														that sort of stuff but I would very much appreciate your
														letting me know what this &ldquo;artwork&rdquo;
														is&mdash;and sending me the proof if it is intended to be
														illustrative. <br />

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Have just read
														your &ldquo;Openings, Absences and Omissions&rdquo; and
														admire very much its clarity and usefulness. The sentence
														&ldquo;Once the customary narrative circuits are broken,
														new chains of historical continuity begin to emerge&rdquo;
														is one of the heaviest marked, in the margin. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">The debate between
														culturalism and structuralism as between movement and
														stasis of analytic position, moves closer to something
														I&rsquo;ve never yet been able really to tease out,
														probably because I haven&rsquo;t fully enough read the
														sources or understood the theoretical debates when
														I&rsquo;ve tried. Certainly the subject as agent of
														experience, as it were objectified in recording but
														without moving away from the specifically personal, I will
														not let go. I will not let the human in the Now somehow
														slip off the board to be examined, and relegate the
														ontological to the intersection of multiplex behaviour
														patternings. What I understand as oppositional or binary
														structures in analysis can be a useful road-digger into
														asking questions about the past; but this only to throw
														up&mdash;not discard&mdash; the points of ontology
														revealed in the subjects that form the structure itself.
														This at any rate is how I like to think of <em>Radical
															Renfrew</em>. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">My thought
														isn&rsquo;t clear there I know. You have a capacity for
														lucidity that I could do with a bit more of myself. Here
														is the West of Scotland Friends of Palestine news-sheet
														that I mentioned I would send you. Sorry I haven&rsquo;t
														done so before: the readings and other things I had in the
														weeks after we met (my busiest time for a good while) left

													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">I enclose among
														other stuff the news-sheet I promised from the West of
														Scotland Friends of Palestinians society. They send it out
														about every two months. I&rsquo;ll send you a copy each
														time in future that I get it. Roxy has been sent one too.
														His Openings, Absences and Omissions will help me towards
														a clearer articulation, I hope, of the distinction between
														culturalism and structuralism that he discusses.
														It&rsquo;s something I do keep coming back to without the
														lucidity of organised reference of which Roxy is capable.
														But it&rsquo;s partly what Radical Renfrew is about I
														think. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Of which I enclose
														two bound copies, now that I&rsquo;ve bought some up. The
														paperback remains in print at &pound;12. I&rsquo;d be
														grateful if you could pass on the signed one to Linton
														when it&rsquo;s convenient. The other one I have not
														signed to you as you have a signed paperback (I presume at
														any rate, my memory is duff these days) and you might want
														to pass it on or whatever. All the best John I hope your
														health continues to improve. <br />

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">Enclosed is
														Kavanagh&rsquo;s &ldquo;If Every You Go to Dublin
														Town&rdquo; which seems to be the poem you&rsquo;re
														looking for. I think your friend probably remembered
														something being said about Kavanagh&rsquo;s bench in
														Dublin: he liked walking by the canal and wrote a poem
														about a commemorative bench there. (It&rsquo;s that
														penchant in Dublin for revered literary landmarks,
														Kavanagh&rsquo;s bench, McDaid&rsquo;s etc that I
														satirised in a little squib &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; in
														Intimate Voices.) <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-family: Arial;">I enclose also a
														photo and a couple of other poems. The long poem
														&ldquo;The Great Hunger&rdquo; is his most sustained
														significant work, and one I think you would find worth
														reading. It&rsquo;s really a polemic about religion and
														bachelordom in rural Ireland, giving the phrase of the
														title a more contemporary relevance than its usual
														reference to the potato famine of a century before the
														poem&rsquo;s being written. </span>
