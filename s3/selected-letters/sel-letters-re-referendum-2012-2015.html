													August 4<sup>th</sup>
													2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p>Dear S--</p>
												<p>I have plenty to say about the so-called Scottish
													government and the arguments around independence, but I
													don&rsquo;t feel like writing an essay just now when all is
													hoovered up into the &ldquo;debate before the
													referendum&rdquo; box. So, most of my opinions will be and
													are presented implicity or explicitly in my web journal. If
													I do write an essay or the like, it will probably be after
													the referendum when it will no longer be contextualised as
													a &ldquo;contribution to the debate&rdquo; about that, or
													an injunction as to how someone should vote.</p>
												<p>.... I write essays for myself first and foremost, to
													work out my words: I do not join in cued colloquia. That
													does not help me to think sharply. ...In time I will put in
													essay form if that seems the best way, my thoughts on the
													notion of essentialist self that can be smuggled into the
													self-determination argument; the discussion as to whether
													nationalism is fine as a strategic last resort against
													oppression of some kind or another, a strategem against
													colonialism. Whether it be from topographical or
													cultural/historic perspective. And how to keep out the
													&ldquo;pure Scot&rdquo; horrors. Whether in short it starts
													from a prescriptive or descriptive base.</p>
												<p>
													The language issue as garnered by the backwoodsmen around
													the SNP cultural committees etc appals me. I see the day
													when people are upbraided for not having good
													&ldquo;Scots&rdquo; as well as good English. Actually that
													day arrived more than a century ago in the schools, and I
													have been fighting it all my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have yet
													to hear a cogent definition of what &ldquo;Scots&rdquo;
													actually is in contemporary society; nor have I heard one
													of its advocates actually speak it themselves. They
													can&rsquo;t, because it isn&rsquo;t there. Nor for heavens
													sake am I "anti Scots"; another thing that angers me about
													these folk is the way they colonise ownership of that which
													they do not speak. For myself apart from what I have done
													with <em>Radical Renfrew</em> and some of my own work, I
													have helped Eunice Buchanan over this past five years to
													her terrific selection of poetry and prose in her
													mother&rsquo;s Angus Scots which Kittelonia are about to
													bring out. But that&rsquo;s not the same at all as some
													generalised case for &ldquo;the" Scots language. How I
													detest that &ldquo;our three languages&rdquo; nonsense at
													that awful parliament, the one where the members heads in
													the chamber seen on television seem to peep out the tops of
													dog traps. No, in Scotland I can look forward in Glasgow to
													many a tourist tea towel with &ldquo;dreich&rdquo; on it.
													It&rsquo;s the nearest there is to fascism in this society,
													and they don&rsquo;t even fucking know. Och, it&rsquo;s
													just a wee titter titter.
												</p>
												<p>I have been toying on the computer just now with a
													sentence that to understand the borderman MacDiarmid you
													have to go to Malta, which, being on the border with Muslim
													north Africa, you can hardly walk a hundred yards on the
													island without encountering one of its over 300 massive
													Catholic chapels. One of them in a little town has the
													biggest dome in Europe second only to St Peters. Here in
													Scotland we call it &ldquo;The Drunk Man Looks at the
													Thistle.&rdquo;</p>
												<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
												<p>July 12, 2013</p>
												<p>Dear J-</p>
												<p>Your email is considerate and generous in the
													circumstance. I appreciate that not for the first time.....</p>
												<p>It's got shifted into the "Scottish" debate too,
													seeing the brand "one scotland" instituted everywhere,
													yesterday going down for the afternoon to Prestwick
													realising that every station and train has now been
													rebranded in the Saltire livery with "Scotland's railway"
													the logo on carriages no matter who runs the fucking thing.
													It's stupid, I feel like I'm the only one seeing this
													language-shift taking place all over the place, and I feel
													being rubbed out by it, or whomever I am part of (and I
													don't mean "the Catholics") being quietly rubbed out by it.</p>
												<p>
													Prestwick was fine and I hope you got back down the coast
													with the weans as you said you might. Down the town today
													to Carlton Place to the Race Equality place, I had found
													menshie of a book not very well titled <em>It Wisnae
														Us</em> which is about Glasgow and the slave trade. They
													published it along with the Architect Institute or some
													such four years ago. Still to read it, think it tries to be
													"balanced" yes, that again, by the last parts going into
													Glasgow as a centre "redeeming itself" their words, with
													its anti-abolitionist stance by many following Hutcheson
													amongst others. I wanted to buy two but they only sold me
													one as they were nearly out of them.
												</p>
												<p>
													Drifted through to Waterstones in Argylle Street, descended
													into gloom in there which I always do in Waterstones no
													matter what spirits I enter in. Back through to Oswald
													Street for the bus, into the Oswald Street Bookshop facing
													Midland Street. Thank goodness. A wholly Scottish and
													serious non-nationalist non literary-tourist environment. I
													hadn't been in for about nine months. Glad it's still

												<p>Dear S -</p>
												<p>Thanks for sending. I find the question "Would an
													independent Scotland chart a different policy?" fairly
													disingenuous, one of these rhetorical questions by which a
													Yes vote garners support for policies that it nowise
													actually demonstrates would accrue. The recent SNP
													"Scottish government" outright support for a nonqualified
													trade agreement with Israel shows where the foreign policy
													land lies, as membership of Nato will confirm for all such
													foreign policy decisions. The Sri Lankan massacres bring to
													mind Liam Fox and the now legendary Mr Werritty and "Lord"
													Bell of the PR firm etc. Nothing whatever in the
													SNP&mdash;the only viable parliamentary show in town come a
													Yes on September 18th&mdash;suggests dissociation from
													this. But perhaps they will get to their position of power
													through all the disingenuous and/or artful rhetorical
													questions about what "independence might mean" without the
													inconvenient detail of spelling out how. That's my take on
													it. As a critique of UK foreign policy, fine. As a marker
													for independence, bullshit, like the guy who told me
													recently that after a Yes vote the SNP would "dissolve" as
													there would be no further need for them. Political parties
													don't dissolve in power I had to say, they congeal. The
													hypnagogic naivety demanded almost as social bonding on the
													Left in Scotland just now I find truly extraordinary, it
													interests me finally almost only as a study in the
													semiotics of social intercourse guised as "politics" in
													these parts, and possibly of use as a comparative marker
													for historic Scottish conversion processes.</p>

												<p>Subject: Re: Vanunu</p>
												<p>Hi</p>
												<p>Thanks for forwarding that. Only reason I left it
													alone is I have a chronic allergy to anything requiring me
													to sign in via Facebook and other Google-owned social
													networks; I would rather not provide them with any more
													information about me than their automatic databases have
													already garnered; being an ordinary member of the public
													who used Google until recently I probably have already
													offered "them" (ie the general corporate networked world)
													more than enough. I feel it's like going to sign a petition
													at a police station, but perhaps that's putting it too
													strongly. Yes, it is important to speak up for Vanunu.
													Personally I wish one thousandth of the energy that is
													being put into naively disingenuous statements about what a
													"yes" vote would mean in September was put into even a
													smidgeon of actual awareness of what has been happening
													this past thirty years and predictably is happening now, in
													Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain, Libya, Egypt; and
													all the other farflung bastions of western influence where
													Scottish sojery has played such a crucial part in
													suppression. How the fuck keeping mum about the SNP as not
													to rock this Nato-powered boat has got anything to do with
													socialism is beyond me.... I have never in my life felt as
													intellectually and poitically alone as I have this past two
													Scottish-essentialist years.</p>

												</p>
												<p>Dear</p>
												<p>... Unrelated Incidents (3) was used for twelve years
													by the English and Welsh GCSE exams (not the Scottish), and
													quite rightly was placed alongside and to be discussed with
													Caribbean and Black English. It is a poem about class
													status and power in language in Britain and has nothing
													whatever to do with "Scottish identity", whatever that is.
													It is appropriate to the language status and power of urban
													speakers in Plymouth, Hackney, Margate, Swansea as it is to
													Glasgow or Aberdeen or even Edinburgh. It is only with the
													rise of nationalism, guised under different names, in
													Scotland, that my phonetic work is now being hijacked
													supposedly to support a Scottish nationalist agenda. In
													fact this means that though for several years I visited,
													along with a troupe of fellow GCSE poets, all the major
													towns and cities of England and Wales; and my participation
													in the daylong event would be not only to read my poems but
													to ask the question "Who owns the language?" and "Who owns
													literature?" Such questions are incapable of being asked in
													Scotland just now in Scottish exams, because under the
													nationalist agenda now being rolled through the Scottish
													education system via the SNP controlled Scottish Civil
													Service, this approach to the work is specifically and
													quite deliberately prevented. Everything has to be subsumed
													to the ubiquitous nationalist fetish, the highly
													politicised word "Scots". And despite what nationalists say
													and now actually teach in the Scottish curriculum, Scots is
													not a language, it is a lexis, which is a quite different
													entity....</p>
												<p>Good luck with the ph.D.</p>
												<p>ps</p>
												<p>Just to add, this is of course not that I disclaim my
													Scottishness nor do I deny a historic basis in my (as in
													anyone&rsquo;s) language. The urban working class language
													pool of which I made my tunes, as I think of them, between
													1969 and 1979, has a phonetic that makes it quite easy with
													practice for a speaker of it to recite eg William Dunbar.
													Easier, that is, than it would be for many Lallans
													advocates whose parents paid to give them an education that
													would preserve their speech from such
													&ldquo;impurities&rdquo;. The whole language question in
													Scotland is no different from England in the respect that
													class matters, due to the difference between paid and
													unpaid education.</p>
												<p>
													There is a historic sectarian, racial and class based
													antipathy to west of Scotland workingclass speech which I
													refer to implicitly in my introduction to <em>Radical
														Renfrew.</em>
												</p>
												<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
												<p>June 2015</p>
												<p>Dear E</p>
												<p>... The whole process of shifting of public opinion
													this past two years I have found extraordinary. As someone
													who has spent the best part of thirty years fiddling with
													my discontent with the language of public media and how it
													influences behaviour, I have of late found myself feeling I
													am living through the millenarian fervour of the West of
													Scotland sects in the 1830's, with the second coming on its
													way and the naysayers demonstrating that they are limbs of
													Satan by saying nay. I find it appalling, really appalling,
													the only commensurate demonstration that comes to my mind
													in recent times being the extraordinary public
													demonstrations and media nonsense that swamped the airwaves
													during the time of Diana's death and funeral. One gets the
													horrible sense that the human language animal is too easily
													turned into a shoal animal, turning as shoals turn. And it
													makes me feel homesick for the only place I begin to think
													of as home, which at the moment I reckon is somewhere on
													the other side of the moon.</p>
												<p>But no. "History through the five senses" as Lawrence
													and William Carlos Williams would have it, which is to say
													the Local. You are an Arbroath and an Angus woman which of
													course means you are a Scot and your language is both Scots
													and Scottish English. Scots which must be local as it in
													sundry survived as locally spoken; when what was medieval
													Scots is or has been bodied as a national language in
													modern times it has been the conceptual embodiment of a
													nationalist project. It is in the actuality of your
													locality as seen and heard that your work and your being
													means something to me. You move out from the self seeing
													and hearing and making understanding, to larger wholes.
													That is the way I like to see my own work, and which in
													Scotland I am pleased to think at least three people
													probably understand. No make that two. The Local means the
													grasp and understanding of what is immediate, the
													questioning of what is there&mdash;and here. The national
													can mean jumping inwards from a perimeter, then trying to
													pack essentialisms supposedly within the perimeter into the
													core self to "demonstrate" its validity (be it
													"Scottishness" etc). This to me is laziness and a lack of
													clarity and questioning. It is the acceptance of "givens"
													before the enquiry itself, rather than starting from the
													immediate, and compiling the givens case by case, outward.
													E-ducere, to educate, to lead outwards.</p>
												<p>Of course there are exceptions and big ones to any
													rule. The card is a paradox first of all and one set out
													within the larger context that assumes the word "local" to
													be something to do with "provincialism", "parochialism"
													etc. This is easily understood by nationalists here as a
													mind-trick employed by metropolitan London and "the
													English" to downplay Scottish culture. What is missing in
													present fervour is the understanding that Scottish
													nationalism can play exactly the same tricks as English or
													UK nationalism is seen clearly to play.</p>
												<p>The "local" is a term/ strategy understood in
													relation to a poet like William Carlos Williams. But think
													of it, how many of the great works of literature are in
													fact set not in a "nation" but a locality? Look at Joyce,
													the supposedly quintessential "Irish" writer. His work
													doesn't move beyond the boundaries of Dublin, albeit he was
													quick enough off his mark to move beyond his national
													boundaries himself.</p>
												<p>Anyway. Keep in touch. Am sorry this letter is not
													the cheeriest of missifs when you say you have been a bit
													down. It is another of the accusations I find is levelled
													at me these days for not being a Yes man that I am
													"pessimistic". Where National Hope is compulsory pessimism
													is a term of abuse. Nietzsche said "A toothless mouth no
													longer has the right to truth." But then he ended his days
													in a mental asylum which was probably something to do with
													wallies not having been invented then.</p>
