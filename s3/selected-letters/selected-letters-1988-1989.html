												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">August 14th 1988</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear J</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The business of
														positing a human We which excludes the referrent I've been
														using not from Chomsky but as an application of the thing
														I worked out in On Reclaiming the Local. That as I see it
														tries to put forward an analysis of how language is used
														to deny the actual existence of others, and does so on the
														assumed agreement that the referrent will not and cannot
														read the thing describing, as that would be to step
														outside the behaviour pattern to the referrent ascribed.
														That logically leads to the sentence that the local, i.e.
														a mass of people, can be bombed out of existence as they
														were never truly in it in the first place. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I felt a fresh
														critical impetus stirring while in Lancaster. For the two
														weeks I gave no conscious thought to the anthology,
														reading instead mainly Lawrence's poetry, and feeling very
														refreshed by that to tackle again in a precise and useful
														way the inhabitants of the Penguin Book of Contemporary
														Poetry, to do the bastards once and for all. I'd be
														developing the telescoped points made about the anthology
														in the Reclaiming the Local Essay, which at least put a
														few torpedoes through it. It's the nature of the
														consciousness that the language offers itself as a model
														of, to which Mr Leonard finds himself returning.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyway. Will have to
														make a Supreme Effort of the Will, or a Boiled Egg on
														Toast, to get the Renfrewshire anthology finally into the
														library in the next few weeks.</span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span><br />

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp; January 21st
														1989</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;Dear Robert
														Creeley</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It was good to hear
														your voice, even if you did seem to hang up. To reiterate.
														I finish in May at my job, after that it would simply be
														as an individual unattached to money sources that I would
														badger places to invite you up, were I to know that you
														were going to be in England at some time. I'd be glad
														enough to do that, though of course I might not succeed. I
														have organised large festivals, sound-poetry ones on an
														arts council budget, and several as writer in residence at
														Paisley. But I'm just a fucking writer, not an impresario.
														I organised two sound-poetry festivals because it seemed
														like the only way that anyone in Glasgow was going to get
														hearing Jandl, Ruhm or Rothenberg. It would be for the
														same reason I'd get involved in trying to get you to
														Glasgow. If I thought anyone else was likely to invite
														you, and be more efficient at it, I'd leave it to them.
														Anyway. I hope we meet up sometime. I follow your work,
														closely as I can, and you helped me to where I am, even
														though we're in very different places, and I had to react
														strongly against you at one point, to get my own bearings
														more precisely my own. Am waiting on the continuation of
														the Black Sparrow letters, which seem to have stopped for
														a while. Well. I don't seem to have made a great job of
														our first contact. When your first letter arrived I walked
														about for ages feeling really uplifted. There you
														are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br />

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Bob </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">A month by since you
														wrote and still I hadn't got back. Not right. Still, I
														have tidied up the desk and the carpet has now been
														hoovered. Been blundering about this past month I don't
														know what the hell I'm doing. Strange days in a hospital
														with them looking for stones in my kidneys. Yes you will
														be missed in May at the festival. I might do what I did
														once years ago at a reading that W.S. Graham couldn't
														make, he was in his last illness at the time. Anyway I
														just read out one of his poems as a gesture that he was
														one of the invited. Graham was a beautiful reader of his
														own work, especially the late stuff: I'll send you a
														cassette of it some time if you don't have one.</span>

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Stewart, </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I'm writing to you to
														put some initial feelers about a series I would be very
														interested in making for Radio Scotland, and wonder if you
														would be interested yourself and could find the place for
														it. The series would be about neglected and forgotten
														poetry of the West of Scotland, and I say a series rather
														than a programme as while writer in residence at Paisley
														Library I have amassed a great deal of material that would
														require I feel a series to do the poets justice. The
														material itself has been shaped into a large book, Radical
														Renfrew: Renfrewshire Poets from the French Revolution to
														the First World War, which will run to over 400 pages and
														is to be published sometime round the end of the year by
														Polygon. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The compilation of
														that book has been a very exciting project for me, and in
														the introduction to the anthology (a copy of which I can
														run off from my Amstrad for you if you wish) I discuss at
														length what has happened to poetry in Scotland since the
														industrial revolution that has caused a nation to wipe
														these poets from its memory. For the radio series I would
														extend the compass of the poetry beyond the strict
														boundaries of old Renfrewshire (which anyway actually
														extended from Greenock practically to the centre of
														Glasgow.) I could fill easily six twenty-minuters I'm
														sure: programmes could be compiled around: 1) David
														Wingate 2) Alcoholism and Domestic Life 3) Marion
														Bernstein and radical feminism 4) Radical Politics:
														Chartists and Republicans 5) Poems about work 6) Town and
														country. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Of course I could add
														a seventh about B.V. Thomson who has had some cult
														following over the years but is still largely unknown. I
														know so much from my research on him, I've sometimes
														swithered about doing a larger programme on him without
														taking it up. Anyway without going into numbers and
														minutes, I send this to see if you are interested at the
														outset. The material itself would be exciting, that I
														believe. There's been such bullshit about poetry in
														Scotland as if the nineteenth century was a kind of
														wasteland with Scott and Stevenson alone apart from one or
														two "minor poets" like Tannahill or Alexander Smith. It
														lends the false aura to the kind of nonsense about "Why is
														it there are suddenly a lot of writers in the West of
														Scotland" as if we have sprung up in a vaccuum. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I'm at Paisley till
														the end of April. I'm working on copy dates for some
														things just now, as I say this is a feeler. I'd hope, if
														you can take me up on this, to be able to start work on
														these matters after June - or whenever suits, if it does.
														If you want me to come through and talk to you about it,
														without any presumption of that meaning anything definite,
														I'd be glad to. I enclose a copy of the "Guide to Themes"
														thing that I have at the front of my Radical Renfrew, as
														it might give an idea of the areas covered. Hope all is
														well with you. All the best just now.</span><br />

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for your
														letter. I'll be happy to do reviews; your interest is the
														more welcome as I've just finished my spell at Paisley
														Library. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The one area I
														couldn't touch would be contemporary Scottish writers, or
														the recent past. The place is too small, and I like to
														relax when I go a walk. Also I like not to know the
														authors of the books I express opinions about. I've been
														doing some review work for The Edinburgh Review this past
														year or so: of course you wouldn't know as their review
														section is anonymous. You can find examples of my reviews
														of e.g. Tytell's biography of Pound &amp; the
														Pound-Zukofsky letters (ER 80-81); Peter Finch's poetry
														(ER 79-80); James Berry's anthology of Westindian British
														poetry News from Babylon (ER 67-68). I've last week sent
														off two reviews for ER 84, due late Autumn: the Faber
														anthology Modern Voices from Africa, and volumes 1 &amp; 2
														of the new Collected Poems of W.C. Williams from Carcanet.
														I've also done one on the Williams for City Limits a few
														weeks back. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This morning Peter
														Kravitz has sent me the new book of Furtwangler's
														notebooks 1924-54 to see if I'm interested in reviewing
														it. I will. Again outside of poetry etc. I've asked him to
														get hold of two new books from Harvard on Lacan and on the
														child psychoanalyst D.W.Winnicott whose theories interest
														me, and whom I wish to refer to in an article on
														"person-centred versus authority- centred language" I'm at
														work on for a future issue.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This last paragraph
														to indicate some areas of my interest. I'll try to
														indicate these as fully as possible on a separate page in
														the hope that that will be of use to you, and you can then
														decide for yourself. I'll be away the first two weeks in
														July. I look forward to hearing from you.</span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;p.s If you
														haven't had the new OUP early Clare reviewed (&pound;155
														for the 2 vols) I'd like a go at that, though no doubt the

														American, especially the Pound-Williams-Olson etc Black
														Mountain tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-standard English, i.e.
														Black poetry, African, Westindian etc. Not Lallans or
														urban Glasgow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Concrete, sound, so-called
														"experimental" poetry in whatever form.&nbsp;&nbsp;
														Nineteenth century Scottish, especially by "minor" poets,
														i.e. not Sir&nbsp;&nbsp; Walter Scott.&nbsp;&nbsp;
														Working-class "artisan" poetry of the nineteenth century,
														from Britain or elsewhere. Other "colonial" poetry e.g.
														Australian, Canadian - though again with a preference for
														the under-rated, or off-the-mainstream, i.e. not Attwood,
														Porter, the present Ulster establishment. Kavanagh,
														Mangan, yes. In all things a bias to the existential. Of
														the English canon this past couple of centuries, Crabbe,
														Clare, Herrick, the early Wordsworth, Hopkins. Lawrence
														the only major twentieth century English poet whose
														prosody really interests me. Preferably not the
														Lowell-Larkin-Heaney mainstream. Definitely not Twentieth
														Century Scottish.

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Novels:</strong>

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Language:</strong>
														Anything to do with language and its relation to power,
														personal or national - apart that is from any specifically
														Scottish angle, which would be too close to my work. Books
														on jargon, propaganda. Dictionaries or reference
														books.&nbsp; Classical Music: Composer/musician

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Years of research on
														the Port Glasgow poet James Thomson (1834- 82) has
														incidentally led to much research on:-</span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														1) Edward Irving, the Gift of Tongues movement, and the
														place of millenialism in British/Scottish society. 2) The
														growth of Army education &amp; the story of Army
														schoolmasters 3) Charles Bradlaugh and the story of the
														secular movement (i.e Humanism, atheism, the National
														Secular society) in 19th cent Britain. This research
														combined with the compilation of the anthology Radical
														Renfrew: Renfrewshire Poetry from the French Revolution to
														the First World War (due Polygon winter 89) has meant
														other areas of nineteenth century expertise are: 4) The
														social history of the West of Scotland, especially with
														regard to Chartism, the Temperance Movement, the 1820
														rising.</span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>&nbsp;Politics&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;
														Events followed closely and in detail. Any reviews of
														contemporary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or of
														past would be from an unaligned-cum-Scottish-Republicanish
														position far to the left of the Labour Party (i.e. even
														further than Mr Heath).</span><br />

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Carl</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I took it you didn't
														want to sign the thing. Fair enough, I don't want to know
														the hinterland of it, but you were loyal to me in
														hospital, so I'm not going to let us be at war. I like the
														anthology, a good big generous swatch, with a distinct
														editorial policy. Good to get surprises, including stories
														by Galt and Hogg that I hadn't read before. I love Galt's
														work, things like Ringan Gilhaize, totally committed, none
														of your detached narrator nonsense. And the Last of the
														Lairds. And those wonderful chapters 19, 23-25 of The
														Entail. Sometimes it seems to me the whole of Scottish
														Literature is about a father making an utter cockup of
														trying to be the Old Testament God. &nbsp;</span>
												</p>

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;I will of
														course play the awful game of My Favourite Scottish Story
														You Didn't Put In, with which you will now be plagued for
														the rest of your life. On the bright side of it you will
														at least get to hear of some good stories. Mine is
														Davidson's "A Boy's Tragedy" - though it may be "The" -
														which is I think the most outraged and sustained - among
														many - of protests at corporal punishment in schools that
														you get in Scottish Literature. Anyway, aside from the
														anthology, it's worth looking up if you don't know it. On
														Hogg by the way, have you seen the Academic Press Poems
														and Songs? It's excellent, including a couple of his great
														parodies of Wordsworth. The two included were new to me,
														though not in the new anthology is "The Flying Tailor",

																style circa 1945-52, written by someone who loves it.
																Concluded by a parody of what some fellow members of the
																writer's class would supposedly make of such niceties.
																I'm afraid I reacted rather badly to a letter from N
																that didn't seem to see what was going on, and thought
																the ending "maybe unnecessary". </span><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /></span></span>

														remembered Asphodel. Have you seen the new Collected
														Williams that New Directions/Carcanet issued? Two volumes,

														the old New Directions series that made up the Collected,
														though I still like the old ones for they kept a lot of
														poems one to a page and were printed nicely, the paper not
														smooth and obviously photographed as the new ones are. A
														strength of the new ones is that they print entire those
														works that mixed poetry and prose, like Spring and All,
														whereas the previous collections just filleted out the
														poems. I've been reading a lot of Clare recently, doing an
														article on him. As you maybe know the latest in his
														definitive edition from Oxford came out earlier this year,
														two volumes of the Collected Earlier Poems up to 1822,
														selling at &pound;155 the set. I managed to get a set that
														was in John Smith's secondhand, some institution had
