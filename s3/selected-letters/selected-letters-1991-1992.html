												<p>
													<span

														K</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;Actually
														I hate interviews, they alway seem such a pig's arse when
														I see them on the page, and I never feel comfortable
														during them. Often I turn them down but as you are in
														contact with the different aspects of my work and we've
														got on ok before then alright I'll give it a bash. As you
														know I like to deal with ideas in my work which is a very
														different thing from dealing with them in an interview. My
														syntax always seems to end up looking inchoate and because
														I speak with a mixture of register and accent often used
														for ironic or emphatic purpose, then in order to get what
														I've said interviewers usually resort in the end to
														attempts to depict my accent, with dire results. However I
														will embark on this in a spirit of trust and cooperation,
														as the politicians say. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Do
														you have all my stuff as listed on the facing title page
														of Radical Renfrew? If you've not you can borrow from me
														or at least let me know. Beyond that there's the essays in
														Edinburgh Review, a series of review-essays I did for the
														Glasgow Herald before the turn of the year (the ones on
														Browning and Clare are I think the best) and an essay on
														"Teaching Poetry in Schools" I did for a teachers'
														magazine that's really the kind of half-way house that was
														needed between the Edinburgh Review essays and the
														introduction to Radical Renfrew, when I got down to it.
														There's also a thing, a kind of sequence-collage that
														throws out a number of ideas about existentialism and
														Stuff called "The Present Tense" which is shortly to
														appear in the Hull magazine <em>Bete Noire</em>. Also I'm
														going to be having another pamphlet brought out in the
														next month, it's a series of questions and answers on the
														Gulf business I managed to write. I'm just finishing an
														introduction to it; the questions were called "Leonard's
														Shorter Catechism, or "And Now would you please welcome St
														Augustine of Hippo, who's come along this evening to talk
														about The Concept of the Just Fuel-Air-Explosive Bomb".
														The whole with introduction will be called "On the Mass
														Bombing of Iraq and Kuwait, commonly known as The Gulf
														War". I'd like very much to talk about that in the
														interview, as it's been what's absolutely screwing me up
														this past few months, and it's still continuing. So I
														could put words to my mouth on that rather more easily
														than on The Language Question etc.
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">I
														mention these things not as I expect you to take a three
														month course on my work but as you are one of the few
														people I know who actually is interested in its different
														parts seeing the ideas then I'm just letting you know I'll
														be happy enough to send you copies of especially the
														recent work that you don't have, since that is part of the
														development still I hope. I was pleased to see you wanted
														to review nora's place. It's been an odd thing getting
														that out; I have been gratified by the response to it from
														some fellow-writers and others (the respect of those you
														intellectually admire, as Mr Gide once put it) but it's a
														work which I told the publisher it would be a waste of
														time sending to the poetry magazines (<em>Verse </em>would
														not even have been considered here) as none of them from
														what I could see used reviewers who would know what the
														fuck it was about. I didn't, nor do I, feel any rancour
														over this either, I just see it as a statement of how the
														position is, and my non-relation to that position. I think
														he would be sending it to a couple of English or American
														magazines that had heard of Black Mountain and Language
														poets etc but that too is just a sliver of it as far as
														I'm concerned. Anyway, when you ring me you can let me
														know if you want anything.

												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Enclosed
														a copy of the booklet now that it's out. Has the magazine
														with the interview appeared? I've a feeling somebody said
														to me they had seen it, though I may have misheard. Tessa
														sent me the Lines Review issue in which your nora review
														appeared. I think that's the only review it's had so far
														as I know, so it will be of help. Thanks for addressing
														the book seriously, and in public, by thunder. </span>

														two. Actually in making that point with relation to
														Reznikoff I was aware that I have never seen the point
														made about any writer anywhere before, in those terms: the
														critical observation had come a long road in my head from
														Kierkegaard's division between the aesthetic and the
														ethical (&amp; on to the religious) in Either/Or. I hope
														your remark doesn't become one of those infectious handy
														off-the-pegs that people then bung on to my work as if
														using a critical given rather than a tool I had to shape
														myself. The fact is that on the level at which I address
														the matter I can't think of a living poet who solves the
														antithesis so postulated. In recent times MacDiarmid was
														too much of a Stalinist to recognise the problem let alone
														solve it; Williams tried in Paterson, and, more
														fundamentally, in his triadic foot; Pound tried to inject
														the stasis of the moment into narrative discourse with his
														Chinese ideograms. Most of what would be considered the
														mainstream of current British poetry is so unexistential
														that the postulates are not even recognised, or are
														presumed soluble within plain old lexis-centred narrative.
														The latter breeds "large structures" quite comfortably,
														but the problem has not been solved, it simply isn't even
														known to be there. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">W.S.
														Graham I think came nearest of late, taking a personal
														history as range from the persona who would address the
														reader in the moment. I'm not saying that MacDiarmid is
														not major, or that when I look at Williams I see a botch.
														They are both more linguistically interesting than
														Reznikoff, whose pieces towards the larger whole are
														totally consistent, but the transcriptions into plain
														description of what was reported in lawsuits or Nuremberg
														trials do not in themselves I think generate much formal
														energy. It's all to do with the aggregate of collocation,
														for Reznikoff the "large structure" with sublevel
														cross-references would be as alien as using nouns like
														switchboards for connecting differing sets of reference. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">In
														my own way maybe what I'm trying to say is that some of
														the "large structures" you indicate I have difficulty
														handling are the ones I feel I have quite legimitately had
														to work very hard to avoid. This has bearing on my Thomson
														book: I will not tell a story with "Jimmy" as the hero.
														The form has to be reinvented each time, for me. I'm not
														saying that's something heroic, or right, or wrong. But
														it's the way it has to be. The "large structure" of
														Intimate Voices was Intimate Voices itself. Nora I see as
														having got back at last to picking up on A Priest Came on
														at Merkland Street, using techniques and arguments, and
														specific philosophical - for want of a better word -
														questions that have occurred in work in between. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">I
														agree that in the Glasgow sequences the poems can be more
														easily used independently; but I have a number of times
														refused people their use that way as I prefer to see them
														as sequences. One reason is that each sequence as sequence
														makes clear that the author has the same voice as the
														described. This lessens the chance of their being seen in
														naturalistic "a man at a bus-stop etc" terms. Nora like
														the Glasgow poems will I think tend to suffer at the hands
														of people seeing it as purely a naturalistic portrait, not
														noticing the shifts from first to third person that go on.
														Who is actually speaking? In "here she comes" etc for
														instance, is this the "narrator", or "nora" so alienated
														from herself that she begins to describe herself in the
														third person? If a narrator, why has this narrator got the
														same speech rhythms as "nora" - and so on. Where are these
														speech things happening anyway - in nora's head? Where
														then would be the best location for a "performance" if so
														desired. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">An
														actor-producer friend reminded me a couple of nights ago
														in the pub that he had once asked me if he could use the
														thing with music added at which I had muttered something
														about Zefferelli productions. On the other hand I told him
														he can use it with his students any time he wants. I hope
														this aint pompous, I don't usually discuss my work at all
														with other people, but you have addressed it seriously and
														I reply in kind with thanks. I'll be in Edinburgh a couple
														of times at the festival - Bookfest August 16th, St
														Cecilians August 30th - if you feel like a crack. All the
														best. </span>

														G</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Am
														just back - a few days - from a holiday in Exeter, much
														enjoyed. Days out to Dartmoor, Sidmouth etc, and the
														cathedral a surprise. What a surprise: a great humanist
														statement on the front of a great medieval structure -
														albeit the facade of 70 human figures include many of
														spiritual iconography. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">About
														your letter, for which many thanks for sending, and
														opening up your honest thoughts. I do think you've
														misunderstood a lot of the speculative thinking of which
														the introduction [to <em>Radical Renfrew</em>] comprises:
														that needless to say is not necessarily your fault, if
														anyone's. For a start the essay is about how content has
														been used as a marker of exclusion: it's got nothing to do
														with certain content being necessary. As to form, the
														lettrist typographical poem of 1853 I thought would have
														destroyed all stereotypes in that quarter. Writing
														lettrist typographical poems is not what the sweaty sinew
														school of verse is supposed to do, let alone in 1853.
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">I
														see the intro myself as among other matters putting
														forward a point of view which not only reclaims the verse
														of the people who follow, but their democratic
														anti-clerical point of view, in the sense of clerisy of
														governmental blockers of direct mediacy. It therefore
														accords with nineteenth century encounterist (here MacLeod
														Campbell would not be irrelevant) religious thinking - and
														anti-clerical - as much as to Paine. Your opening remark
														that the first sentence would be more appropriately
														discussed elsewhere (in the room with "Society" on the
														door, I mutter) puts as a given that which the
														introduction says is the problem. Neither in the
														introduction nor here do I intend listing criteria, other
														than the criteria normally assumed of exclusion. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Read
														my essay in the current Cencrastus for another word on
														this if you want. To my mind this fundamental
														misconception leads to a statement such as "He contrasts
														Community with High Art". I not only do nothing of the
														kind, but I write that such contrasts are bogus. As for
														the individual responses to the works, the idea that this
														anthology is putting forward some idea that content is
														more important than awareness of language or form I find
														extraordinary, and defensive. Of course though the
														anthology is a record of what the subject Leonard
														encountered as authentic language clusters indicating a
														specific: the leather bound "town poets" for which Paisley
														was known were to a man - and it was a man - largely
														completely moribund, off-the-shelf suits of dead language
														for classicalised pastoralese, wholly "competent forms",
														wholly unrealised as language containing any energy
														whatever. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">You
														admire the MacLeod entry for instance as a "competent
														poet". To me his verse is an example of someone who had
														swallowed whole the Tennyson whom his father had met. I
														actually include his poem solely for the last line, which
														came alive to me as a remarkable surprise ending,
														containing a personal grief and a kind of glancing
														reference to a history of a people, in one. That's not
														because that's an "approved thought" that "got my ok" or
														some nonsense. It's because it came alive. In this, as in
														ALL the poems, my connection had to be something that was
														experienced primarily. Your letter gets close to that old
														stuff that the "non-political" always accuse the
														"political" of, i.e. of having a kind of pair of specs
														that are put on to see if the correct attitudes are shown
														up. As for Semple and Daniel King. Semple is an example of
														the "Temperance Song" sung at meetings, and quite
														competent too: King on the other hand has got damn-all to
														do with humour: it's one of the bitterest poems about
														alcoholism I know, and as I think you would know if you
														ever heard me read it. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Do
														you have a cassette machine which can dub cassettes? If so
														I can send you the three cassettes with the six radio
														programmes I made based on the book; or I can give you
														them anyway so long as I get them back reasonably soon as
														I regularly get people wanting to tape them. Anyway the
														contrast between Semple and King as I see it is precisely
														that very important contrast I mention between the
														Temperance song genre and the poem about alcoholism - both
														neglected, censored from people's historical
														consciousness. For goodness sake --- what are you trying
														to protect? You sound like a censor. Do you really think I
														am someone who doesn't care about language? Or are you
														worrying about folk if not wholly like me trying to clear
														you off the stage if you're not explicit about certain
														subjects? I'm trying to enlarge Literature, not narrow it.
														Or rather, I'm pointing out that it has been shrunk to a
														governable narrowness by those more interested in the
														power of governing than the cognition of an equality of
														human existence. Or rather, I'm not trying to point
														anything out at all: I compiled a chronological sequence
														of those human language products classified as poetry that
														I encountered in a certain period pertinent to a certain
														place; the result showed me that my inspiration had been a
														visit to Knossos, another defined area subject to
														speculative excavation by another person some time ago. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">I
														leave the definitions that are not necessary to those for
														whom they are necessary. Or, that's all very well, but is
														it a novel? etc. etc. etc. I really do wish people weren't
														brought up to see Art as a cue for the establishment of a
														hierarchy of value-categories - "mere" verse "versus"
														poetry etc. The only interesting way of approaching that
														subject, and that in a spare moment, would be to examine
														how the words function as distinct from what they are
														supposed to mean. That, again, has been my approach to the
														supposed "given"s of the word poetry. File under yellow
														tab. File society under red. All this said by the way
														seeing your own poetry as having nothing whatever to do
														with what I am arguing against in your letter. If I am
														arguing: sorry if my response seems crude, I am doing this
														in a one-off. Am still editing down B.V. and I wish it was
														finished, as I work far too slowly. My last word about
														Radical Renfrew. It is a shape, as well as an area of
														encounter. I'll probably be having a day in Edinburgh in
														the next 10 days at the National Library. I may do that
														the day I'm to be at the Bookfest, or maybe another day.
														Do you fancy having a lunch somewhere or a pint? I seem to
														remember you don't like the latter, though maybe I'm
														wrong. </span>

												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Thanks
														for your letter. I haven't written any more about the
														situation in Iraq, I doubt if I could. The whole business
														was giving me a headache every day when the bombing was
														on, it was the first time in my life I found for a couple
														of weeks I couldn't look at the tv or read a paper as I
														couldn't handle the feelings that it provoked. But always
														with a lot of people in conversation there would be this
														sense of this country's Dark Secret in the background,
														apart from the Rambo types. It certainly sorted out those
														who were prepared to line up behind the guns in any
														circumstances; made it seem quite ironic the way it's
														presented as if during the Second World War the Germans
														must have been very unBritish people to have let the
														Holocaust happen. This seemed all so matter of fact,
														"common sense" after all - just like that. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">I've
														been heartened when reading the Catechism at readings - I
														have insisted on reading it at every reading I've done
														since I wrote it - there's usually been at least one
														person afterwards who has thanked me. That makes me feel
														less isolated and glad if it's helped to make somebody
														else feel less isolated as well. The silence about Iraq
														now, apart from the odd Why Saddam Is a Beast topping-up
														item in the news, can make you feel as if it's you that
														has the guilt of knowledge, not the government which has
														the unacknowledged guilt of the action itself. It's quite
														amazing, the way the news controls people to just forget
														or accept what is actually happening. Now the Russians
														have qualified to be human beings maybe we'll get a
														beaming Jeffrey Archer organising another rock concert. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">We
														have a son of 18. When he was 3 we used to share the
														business turn about of taking him to the local nursery
														with an Iraqi couple who also had a 3-year-old. After the
														father had finished the degree he was doing in Glasgow the
														family went back to Basra. So now the chances of their
														being alive, especially the boy's, aren't great. I was
														watching John Simpson on the BBC in his one report from
														Basra a couple of months ago doing the solemn pointing-out
														stuff at some shellmarks in a building, the work of
														Hussein's forces, Simpson said. Perhaps he was right. The
														poor Shi'ites. Of course what he forgot to mention, which
														the French Medical Team's report did, was that Basra was
														carpet-bombed by B-52 Bombers, the ones that flew from
														Gloucestershire. But now John Simpson has his CBE, and
														never was it more richly deserved. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">The
														truth will out though, I do believe that. People like John
														Pilger surely will blow the gaff really some day, though
														how much it will be reported is another matter. Very
														convenient how as soon as the last report spoke of the
														generation of Iraqi infants unlike to last the year out,
														we were suddenly swamped with biological warfare and
														supergun stories again. That took care of the Public
														Sympathy angle. But the truth will out some day, they
														can't keep this one covered up. Thanks a lot for writing,
														sorry if I'm a bit gloomy in the reply, not that you'd
														expect something lighthearted in this. </span>

												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Here's
														the stuff you wanted to see, I got to the university
														photocopier with it at last. You could maybe give Norman
														McLeod a copy if he's likely to be interested. I imagine
														I'll be putting these things into the anthology that Cape
														are bringing out next year supposedly as a follow-up to
														Intimate Voices. The Thomson book has taken so long though
														I think I'll suggest to them that they make it a sort of
														Collected So Far and I'll bung in satire and criticism and
														various odd things as well as the poetry. That's the way
														I'd like to do it now anyway. Places of the Mind continues
														to drive me up the wall in terms of its still being not
														totally completed. I've got an editor who's already done
														her editing of all but the last chapter (her parcel
														remains unopened, as I don't want to get involved in that
														just yet), I've been given the dosh I was due on handing
														it in, it's in the catalogue for October and I've nearly
														all the notes - but I'm still trying to get the last
														chapter the way I want it. The phone is removed from the
														wall most days, though that's more difficult when the
														family's here. I've had to point out to Stephen, my
														younger one, that "He's out" sounds less convincing when
														you ask who it is first. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Where
														the book has taken me continues to provide little
														surprises. The first chapter goes fairly thoroughly into
														the whole gift-of-tongues business around the Port
														Glasgow-Gareloch area. I don't know if you know anything
														about that, one of the things associated with it was the
														publication of a memoir of Isabella Campbell who died at
														Fernicarry on the Gareloch in 1827, her memoir sold in
														thousands and as one book put it if Scotland had been a
														Catholic country she would probably have been seen as a
														saint. I'd never been around the Roseneath place where she
														would be buried, so last Sunday being a fine day Sonya and
														I went up that way, I wanted to see the grave and if
														possible the site of where her farmhouse had been. At
														first we found various people had never heard of
														Fernicarry, but then a local told us it was still there.
														The site of where the original farmhouse was has of course
														recently been bought by the Ministry of Defence who else,
														but it turns out that near the present now derelict farm
														on the hillside there is a little walled-in area beside a
														burn at the point where it turns, and makes a waterfall
														over some boulders. There's a plaque on the wall with
														"Here Isabella Campbell Used to Pray.&rdquo; </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">The
														woman who directed us to it said that her daughter had
														come running in one day saying she'd found this place on
														the hill, the woman described it as a "really sort of
														magical place". She didn't know anything about Isabella
														Campbell other than as she put it she was supposed to be
														someone who thought she could walk on water and got
														drowned, or something like that. Complete nonsense.
														However in this last chapter the waterfall on the burn is
														definitely making an appearance. Glass eyes will be dabbed
														or I won't be doing my job. If I don't see you before it
														I'll get an invitation sent for when the book's coming
														out. I know Cape want to do various things to do with its
														launch as they hope for Scottish Book Fortnight, and
														Edinburgh will no doubt figure in that. All the best. </span>
