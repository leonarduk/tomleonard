												<p>January 22nd 1999</p>
												<p>Dear Lee [Harwood]</p>
												<p>Great to hear from you. You saying you&rsquo;d like
													to be in Glasgow makes me very much like to be in Brighton
													just now to meet. The light has got to be better down
													there. Been a few miraculously clear days here, but mostly
													the Windsor Brown soup with grey cream that you get up here
													for weeks on end. You could hold the sky up with a clothes
													pole. Relation between that and T.B. - and millenialism of
													course. I think myself you&rsquo;re going to be tripping
													over the buggers all over the place with the Magic Number
													coming up next year.</p>
												<p>Thomson was a very traditional formalist who loved
													Spenser and Shelley on whom both he leant for so much of
													his own style (and Dante). But he loathed most of the
													insularity going on in Britain. Apart from Heine and
													Leopardi it was the continental prose he hitched into most
													of his time, though he did read Baudelaire (passing
													reference somewhere) and Gautier he translated. So he
													wasn&rsquo;t so head in the formal sand. I just love the
													existentialism of him, straight on a path that has Hogg of
													the Justified Sinner (whom Gide rightly picked up)
													Lermontov, Kierkegaard, Barbusse, Sartre of Nausea, all in
													there with Thomson. And that directness of address - to
													whomever you are: an address to everyman from someone who
													says you probably won&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking
													about, and if you do, you know already anyway. That opening
													proem seized me by the throat, when I first read it in the
													seventies and I still remember finally finding the grave
													twenty years later, book completed, feeling that the points
													had finally joined up in between.</p>
												<p>...You have your own way and angles with language, so
													sharp and delicate, it was great seeing you reading as if
													you were placing each word like birds on wires, carefully,
													speedily and dexterously, enjoying your placing as you
													went. Like watching a first class musician in flow. Hope
													that&rsquo;s not patronising to try to say.</p>
												<p>There&rsquo;s always a spare bed up here for you if
													you ever want to see Glasgow. You will be given a key and
													you can come and go as you please.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
												<p>Thursday November 18th 1999</p>
												<p>Dear Eck (Finlay)</p>
												<p>....</p>
												<p>What you say about your little hare called Cowper
													reminds me that I was recently thinking of Stonypath when
													reading this excerpt from Cowper&rsquo;s long poem
													&ldquo;The Task&rdquo;:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
													<img src="http://tomleonard.co.uk/images/cowper-1.jpg"
														alt="cowper 1" />
												</p>
												<p>He goes on to compare it with distant floods, and
													fountains, concluding</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
													<img src="http://tomleonard.co.uk/images/cowper-2.jpg"
														alt="cowper 2" />
												</p>
												<p>&nbsp;It brought me back to standing under the tree
													at Stonypath with the sea inscription.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>
													[<em><i>From a letter to Alec Finlay. His father
															Ian Hamilton Finlay's garden at Stonypath has a tree with
															the inscription "Mastrum Nore" on it. I had found the
															poem realised once when looking to the hills beyond the
															tree standing with the wind waving the leaves overhead]</i></em>
												</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
												<p>Thursday September 13th 2001</p>
												<p>In February 1991 I wrote in a published pamphlet
													against the bombing of Iraq, "One would have thought that
													it might at least have occurred to people that there will
													be Iraqi survivors, or their descendants, who will feel
													that if there is any justice in the world, the cities of
													Britain and America will one day get at least a little of
													what their citizens were apparently so indifferent to
													inflicting on the towns and cities of Iraq."</p>
												<p>What has happened in America now is not justice:
													there is no justice in murder, in or out of uniform, no
													justice in killing thousands of people just getting on with
													their work, and the people who went to try and save them.
													There is certainly no justice, but there was certainly an
													inevitability that action would one day be taken against
													America, albeit no-one could have predicted that it would
													be on such a massive catastrophic scale.</p>
												<p>Ten years after that bombing of Iraq and that little
													pamphlet of mine, with another 500,000 Iraqi children dead
													because of sanctions, according to official figures a
													couple of years back, where now. More of the same,
													apparently. Mr Blair, the evangelist who varies between
													crackdowns and crusades, has found a cause to combine both.
													No historical context of course, it is to be against
													"evil". And though it may be a crusade, we should not give
													the word a capital letter. People might get the wrong idea.
													After all, as he said in a speech today "The vast majority
													of Muslims are decent people." That&rsquo;s alright then.</p>
												<p>No-one in government, here or across the Atlantic,
													will link the week&rsquo;s events with the recent further 2
													billion dollar sale of attack jets to Israel. After all, as
													Mr Netenyahu said in a press conference on Wednesday, we
													must all unite against &ldquo;terrorist states like Iraq,
													Iran, Afghanistan, and the Palestinian entity&rdquo;. And

												<p>Wednesday September 8th &rsquo;04</p>
												<p>To: The Royal Literary Fund</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Tom McGrath has phoned me to say it would be
													appropriate for me to send you a letter on his behalf
													regarding his application for Royal Literary Society funds.</p>
												<p>Like many a writer in Scotland I owe a significant
													amount to Tom McGrath and welcome the opportunity to
													acknowledge this.</p>
												<p>When he came to Glasgow from London in the late
													1960&rsquo;s, he galvanised the incipient writing situation
													that he found there.......For writers like myself, Alan
													Spence and others, he simply had the most exciting grasp
													and infectious enthusiasm for current poetry developments
													in America, Europe and elsewhere that more conservative
													circles simply shunned. His house became a place where
													poets and other writers were always welcome, where they
													could drop in any day of the week, be ushered into the
													kitchen and as likely as not into as wideranging and
													challenging a discussion about poetry and literature as was
													to be found anywhere in the city. I do not mean to be
													anti-academic, but simply state what I experienced, when I
													say that though i was a student at Glasgow University, it
													was to Tom McGrath&rsquo;s house that I and others went to
													further our understanding of and excitement in poetry.</p>
												<p>He set to work founding the Midnight Press in Glasgow
													that first published my Six Glasgow Poems which made
													something for a name for me, my first publication. The
													press published a string of other poets, the excellent Ann
													Thomson, and of course Edwin Morgan. When Tom became
													director of the new arts venue the Third Eye Centre in
													Glasgow, the city became a hub for exciting poetry and
													drama events. Tom himself was not simply a producer or
													activateur in this. He wrote and recited his own poetry,
													publishing I remember the booklet &ldquo;The Bhudda
													Poems&rdquo;, though he never put his own work to the fore.
													Then he took the Third Eye Centre into publishing. More
													work by myself and others there first came into print. I
													find it ironic that thirty years later work of mine that
													Bloodaxe and Carcanet have offered to publish, work that
													has been set now as GCSE English poetry texts, the only
													person who would publish it at the outset of my career was
													Tom McGrath.</p>
												<p>After I married and moved to London, Tom moved
													further into drama, his plays The Hard Man and Laurel and
													Hardy, both notable successes, I remember as very enjoyable
													and intelligent theatre events. I understand that Tom has
													asked someone closer to his continuing drama work in
													Edinburgh to comment on this for you. It is common
													knowledge though that for years there he worked crucially
													as a significant promoter of new dramatic talent, taking
													sundry new writers scripts from editing to stage
													production.</p>
												<p>I find it quite simply heart-rending to see him in
													his present post-stroke condition, his partner working as
													nanny for a local couple&rsquo;s child in an attempt to
													make ends meet. Tom has been such a force for the
													advancement of literature in Scotland, if the nation had
													any way to acknowledge such a force, it should surely make
													such acknowledgment. I actually don&rsquo;t know, to be
													truthful, how he fits into the categories that the
													committee have for applicants. I can only say that I admire
													his achievements as a writer, and I am one of many writers
													and others in Scotland who owe him a debt of thanks. I do
													sincerely hope something can be done for him.</p>

												<p>March 16th 2005</p>
												<p>Hi R--</p>
												<p>My own position re the uni, to get it out of the way
													here, is really simple. When I was writer in residence at
													Bell College between 1993 and 1995 I saw very clearly what
													my wife and friends had then been complaining about in
													public education, and why people were becoming very low of
													morale, or retiring &ndash; in those days often with a
													&ldquo;package&rdquo; aged about fifty. At least I got some
													poems out of it as well as a wage for a while: the poem
													&ldquo;opting for early retirement&rdquo; in access to the
													silence refers.</p>
												<p>
													As I see it the history is not awfully complex. The Second
													World War, as evinced by such as the conclusions to some of
													the Sherlock Holmes films made then [<em><i>see
															letter of Sep 7<sup>th</sup> 1998
													</i></em>] posited the notion of a classless united Britain, a
													notion necessary to fight the war and counter German
													propaganda. Hence the reforming Labour Government of 1945,
													the National Health Service, council housing driven forward
													in the next two decades, new schools for all. Then Wilson
													in 1967 elected, and right away complaining of &ldquo;the
													gnomes of Zurich&rdquo; as the press derided his
													complaints, ie that banking institutions were threatening
													to withhold funds if he continued with public spending
													plans. 1976 was the real clincher: when Labour Chancellor
													Dennis Healey introduced the concept of
													&ldquo;rate-capping&rdquo;, &ldquo;fining&rdquo; many
													thousands of pounds local authorities who
													&ldquo;overspent&rdquo; their centrally allocated funding
													allocation. This became the driving force of Thatcherite
													monetarism, multiplied in quantity by Blair. Though Blair
													like the American Democrats favoured liberal social
													policies, but ever more rightwing monetarist economic
													policies.
												</p>
												<p>So from the late eighties the government policy of a
													target-driven culture of public services: targets of
													performance indicators, which must go up: targets of cost,
													which must go down. The one multiplied by the other was
													supposed to be a measure of &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo;. Never
													was the word efficiency taken to mean the quality of
													service offered. So in Bell College, one of thousands of
													public instutitions, there was the concomitant obsession
													with press publicity as an indication of performance,
													marketing logos, the ubiquitous mission statements. A
													bastardisation of language. All to do with the denial of
													the value of a human being as being itself. Central again,
													the structure of the line management, each layer bearing
													down on the one below in term of &ldquo;yield&rdquo;.
													Co-operating with management, competing with colleagues.
													Demoralised teachers had been in at the start of Bell
													College in the early seventies when it helped working class
													local kids make up highers in English etc to get to
													college. Now English had gone, leaving journalistic studies
													and media studies or &ldquo;communications&rdquo;. A whole
													library of literature gathered by good staff was totally
													idle. Trade Union studies began to disappear, Business
													Studies everywhere.</p>
												<p>...The battle in all this I see in my own quiet in
													fact non-Marxist way as simply Being versus Having.
													That&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;ve seen it all my life, and
													the way I&rsquo;ll see it till I die. I&rsquo;m a being man
													meself. You rightly point out that the scrapping of
													part-time students would effectively pull the rug away from
													all local opportunity for people to work their way through.
													Well, go where the money is, - just like the Scottish
													Premier League, the tendering of public services, the
													cutting of cleaning staff and increase in the hospital bug,
													and so on and on you know the story at least as well as I
													do.</p>
												<p>............ In the nature of this freemarket stuff
													staff are of course expected to feel guilty. There is
													always someone who apparently works even more than everyone
													else, and just like the school league tables, the message
													is not to congratulate the greatest yielder, but to berate
													the rest for not &ldquo;achieving&rdquo; the same. So if I
													and other part-timers hold to perimeters of duty, we can be
													exposed to the &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; of letting extra work
													heap on the already besieged fulltimers. Again it is
													absolutely standard this shit, right across target-driven
													public services. I say, let the fulltime staff draw up
													their own fair perimeters &ndash; and insist on holding to
													them.</p>
												<p>This is the rant you will not be getting in Beanscene
													should we ever meet there.... Fuck all this, I am happy, I
													am writing, I am happy working with the students, so long
													as I get peace just to get on with the patient job in my
													own way. But I don&rsquo;t have a huge number of years
													left, I&rsquo;m not going to, or am going to try not to,
													get too worked up over the simple brutal operation of
													market forces which I have seen and got to know back to
													front ages ago. If we are driven, out of this supposedly
													&ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; transparency review, to the
													competitive humiliation of totting up supposed hours spent
													individually and measuring these against results per person
													etc, which seems to be the next inexorable stage, ach fuck
													it, I either go or I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not thinking
													beyond the near future, let me stay happy in the present.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>

												<p>Saturday August 27th &rsquo;05</p>
												<p>Dear Tom [McGrath]</p>
												<p>
													I have been out of touch for so long. I have had your
													letter sitting on my desk in a wee tray thing for ages. It
													was good to get it. About your play <em><i>My Old
															Man</i></em> we will definitely go to see that in the Tron, during
													the second week, we are, thank fuck, going to Portugal for
													the best part of a fortnight, coming back on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.
													I want to do nothing and be a thousand miles from the
													university spire and Blair&rsquo;s Britain. Though I will
													bring my laptop. Saw a travel programme years ago about the
													Algarve and sardines getting grilled in the open just off
													the boat. I&rsquo;ve wanted ever since to be in the queue.
												</p>
												<p>
													It was great seeing the reviews of your <em>Laurel and
														Hardy</em>. Sorry you weren&rsquo;t well enough to get the best
													of it. Tom Logan, Liz Lochhead&rsquo;s man, he said it was
													the best night he had had in the theatre for years. I hope
													you make it to Dublin.
												</p>
												<p>My wee run of poems seems to be over for another
													spell, though I do still spend the odd dawn out hoeing on
													the Parnassian slopes. But nay blooms for sale yet. Just
													rows of wee pots with things sticking out them. You were
													saying though you were glad of my slant on the Middle East
													business, well I did do an article, a preface for this guy
													Mahmood Jamal&rsquo;s poems that WordPower bookshop are
													bringing out. I dragged my feet for ages over it .....ended
													up writing what is more a political take on the current
													situation than anything to do with Mahmood&rsquo;s poems.
													I&rsquo;ll bung it in for your perhaps interest.</p>
												<p>
													I&rsquo;ve done that and another article for this Catholic
													magazine called <em><i>Conscience </i></em>.... actually an
													American thing run by an organisation called Catholics for
													a Free Choice &ndash; in other words a pro-abortion group
													that also in its mag keeps running its finger over Catholic
													attempts at censorship and Vatican political influence at
													the United Nations etc. The only Catholic publication I
													know with a sane attitude to sexuality. Anyway after an
													article by one of its editors bemoaning that you seemed to
													need to get raped or something to become a female saint I
													ended up, after correspondence, being invited to do an
													article. I wanted to write on the way women who died
													resisting rape were promulgated as &ldquo;martyrs to
													purity&rdquo; &ndash; though resisting rape has got nothing
													to do with staying &ldquo;pure&rdquo; in the first place.
													It was hard work, reading and comparing papal encyclicals
													etc online, and three months with my head jammed reading
													sundry books on the Cult of the Virgin and the history of
													Marianism etc, from Catholic, feminist and Protestant
													viewpoints. I hadn&rsquo;t realised the extent to which the
													difference between the Catholic and Protestant viewpoints
													is not exclusively the business of transubstantiation but
													an attitude to prayer and the Virgin Mary. Prods improvise
													prayers to Jesus, Papes hardly pray directly to Christ at
													all.
												</p>
												<p>Anyway I got the fucker finished, but have now run
													into one of those editors who has informed me that he wants
													to change just the odd thing as &ldquo;I am an editor and I
													edit&rdquo;. I have informed him in turn that I am a writer
													and I write. I don&rsquo;t send off things as an opening
													gambit, I put gambits in the drawer or sell them to the
													National Library of Scotland. He is off on holiday. I have
													told him to accept it entire &ndash; he did say he thought
													it &ldquo;great&rdquo; &ndash; or ask me to consider my
													changing just the odd word myself if it really strikes him
													that way, or just forget about the thing altogether. I
													won&rsquo;t be too upset if it comes to that, it was a
													necessary albeit tortuous thing to write. I was ultimately
													relating the Church&rsquo;s inability to deal properly with
													its own cases of internal rape and abuse, with the cult not
													of the Virgin, but of virginity ...</p>
												<p>I was 61 last Monday so I am sitting typing this with
													Maria Callas pouring notes all over me from the fancy Mac
													speakers Sonya got me that connect to the computer.
													Terrific sound. And Michael got me a boxed recording of
													Wagner&rsquo;s ring that I wanted. Trouble with the Ring as
													a story though is it&rsquo;s such anti-humanist science
													fiction. I hate this Struggle Between Universal Ideas
													stuff, at the expense of the human. No wonder Adolf had the
													autographed Siegfried and Die Walkure in his possession,
													that were never found after his death. Still there&rsquo;s
													great music in it which is why I wanted it.</p>
												<p>Will let you know how we enjoyed your play. Sorry I
													never made it up during the summer after all.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
