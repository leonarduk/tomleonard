													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tuesday March 4th
														&lsquo;97</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Anne</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Afraid I&rsquo;ve
														been in hedgehog mode through most of January and
														February, curled up in the corner of my cupboard. Thank
														goodness it&rsquo;s sunny today, the wind&rsquo;s dropped,
														and the blue tits and what I think is a greenfinch have
														been vying for places on the feeder I have attached with
														suckers to the living room window.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">To G...: yes of
														course whomever you invited will be fine by me and
														I&rsquo;m not looking to have someone sympathetic
														particularly to any of my own hobbyhorses at all. My being
														somewhat taken aback was because I have only read with him
														once, at a Burns bicentenary festival at Strathclyde
														University last year. There were about ten readers, this
														after a dinner that concluded a three-day event.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was looking forward
														to hearing G and one or two others I hadn&rsquo;t heard.
														But he stood up and read this lengthy (it seemed very long
														indeed) rhyming couplets verse monologue about his living
														as a poet in ---, largely ignored since he did not come
														from Glasgow&mdash;which was given too much attention in
														Scotland&mdash; and because he was interested in writing
														sonnets and in engaging in genuine craftsmanship, rather
														than trendy formless free verse stuff.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">All this without
														irony or wit. One sat with that smile on one&rsquo;s face
														as one does at such occasions, thinking as one does, Fuck
														you too Jimmy&hellip;. The thought of that type of
														young-old-fogey bullshit being lain down so arrogantly to
														people I&rsquo;m trying to help in their writing, does not
														appeal. But I get from your letter there are much
														healthier aspects elsewhere in his work: I&rsquo;ll look
														them out, I meant to before this. &lsquo;Twill be all
														right on the night nay doot. Am looking forward to the
														rest of the week.</span>
												</p>

														March 24th &lsquo;97 <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Dear
														Philip <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Thanks
														for the MacKay review. I&rsquo;d missed it, though I have
														Paddy Hogg&rsquo;s book and I know MacKay&rsquo;s views on
														it: there was a debate hosted by the John McLean society
														in a pub in London Road between the two about a month ago.
														I had to miss that too, though I had reports. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">MacKay
														I have time for, in fact I was very pleased to hear he got
														the Saltire Award for his Burns biography. His editions of
														the poems and the letters are I think excellent,
														discreetly scholarly but very &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo;
														to use the contemporary cliche, and recognising frankly
														his debts. His recent Alan Pinkerton biography has certain
														defects and has perhaps come out too quickly on the heels
														of his previous work. But he is a man certainly to be
														respected. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Hogg,
														whom I have met twice, is very deep indeed into what he is
														researching. Very valuable research it is, though I look
														forward very much more eagerly to an anthology of the best
														of the newspaper material as a whole rather than the
														continuance of claims to new addition to the Burns oeuvre.
														I can&rsquo;t at the moment get involved in what has
														become there for me something that is too personal, and
														political not in the radical sense. It&rsquo;s a pity
														about the book itself, which is a rushed job, and
														patchwork quilts of phrase and word congruences do not and
														never will establish authorship. But I wish Paddy well, I
														like him, and just hope that he calms down a bit getting
														on with the work. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">
														It reminds me of when I was researching Thomson, and first
														discovered John Cumming and his apocalyptic sermons. How I
														thirsted to find out if Thomson had been in Exeter Hall
														between 1848 and 1849. How I knew that it would have been
														surely out of the question for the boys of the Asylum not
														to have been sent there! And how one gets sucked too
														easily&mdash;if one doesn&rsquo;t watch&mdash;into a

												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">What
														does really interest me about this debate is that at its
														heart is the legacy of still unresolved dilemmas of the
														1790&rsquo;s. Burns of course died at a very crucial phase
														of Scottish and Irish history, that testing time when the
														lessons of the American and French revolutions might point
														towards democracy, but republicanism pointed to the
														destruction of the basis of the Protestant
														Constitution&mdash; &ldquo;the keystone of our Royal
														arch&rdquo;&mdash;as Burns protested when accused of
														subversion. It is not trivial to note that Burns died the
														same month as the first Twelfth of July parade in Ulster.
														The gang culture of Orangeism imported to Scotland was
														part of that which redefined the nature of freemasonry, in
														my opinion. Burns became a calendar icon of Orange and
														freemason culture, of one-man-to-another, of What
														We&rsquo;re Not and This Patch is Ours. <br />
													</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span
														style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">
														It runs deep, however discreet on the surface. And
														it&rsquo;s still trying to ward off thecommunists etc who
														wanted Burns the child of the enlightenment
														socialist-in-anticipation. That&rsquo;s the real battle
														behind the MacKay-Hogg debate&mdash;whether or not in the
														protagonists themselves. <br />

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Matt (Ewart)</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for the essay
														on Burns Singer. His earnest engagement with language and
														its relationship with being is what interests me in him,
														though it&rsquo;s his images created of the sense of the
														dissociation such an awareness can bring that can be for
														me the most telling: I mean that great image of the sparks
														and the tramcar, and the very fine passage you quote from
														Marcus Antoninus Aurelius. It&rsquo;s refreshing to read
														somebody nailing their critical colours to the mast as you
														do: you obviously feel as passionately about Singer as I
														do about the other language man of these parts, W.S.
														Graham.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Perhaps a sure
														indication of Singer&rsquo;s greatness is Bold&rsquo;s
														belittling of his achievement. Before I stopped reading
														&cedil;the Herald I had noted his dismissal of Morgan,
														Graham (&ldquo;an egocentric solipsist&rsquo;) and MacCaig
														&ldquo;squandered a great talent&rdquo;. I always regret
														not writing that letter to the Herald that occurred to me
														beginning, &ldquo;Whether Alan Bold would have squandered
														a great talent is something we can never know.&rdquo;</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Friday night I
														enjoyed very much. The young fiddler was terrific, and Meg
														Bateman reading was a revelation to me, I hadn&rsquo;t
														heard her before. I love Monty Montgomery&rsquo;s readings
														and translations: there&rsquo;s seems to be some very fine
														and sensitive things happening in female Gaelic poetry
														just now.</span>

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Marion</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I hate the phone. You
														get asked things and you&rsquo;re suddenly having to make
														a snap decision, and it can sound abrupt and not thought
														out. Anyway I still think the six o clock news isn&rsquo;t
														the poem for the kind of book you&rsquo;re describing,
														though I have nothing at all against contributing to a
														book of funny stuff, and yes people do talk about a hoot
														meaning a right good laugh, for which I am all in favour.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">But I still think
														that for instance although Edwin Morgan&rsquo;s Ozymandias
														would be right for a book like you describe with Ivor
														Cutler and others, something like the First Men on
														Mercury, a kind of cousin to it, or the Loch Ness Monster,
														would not be. These other two poems are also funny poems,
														buﬁt they&rsquo;re poems in a way doing something with
														language that to put them under the title &ldquo; a
														hoot&rdquo; would somehow be leading the reader away from
														something else in the poems, and something that&rsquo;s
														important. It&rsquo;s not that humour aint a serious
														business as they say, but of course all that&rsquo;s funny
														isn&rsquo;t accurately described as comic. Comedy&rsquo;s
														an essential, but to me it&rsquo;s essential that
														it&rsquo;s differentiated from things that happen to be
														funny: the point of comedy it seems to me is in its being
														funny&mdash;not anything else.</span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyway I enclose
														something I am quite happy to have called a hoot if you
														want to use it at all: I had a great time with Alasdair
														Gray and Liz Lochhead writing Tickly Mince, and watching
														the actor Kevin McMonagle nightly doing his Frank Sinatra
														with this. It would be good to see it in print actually:
														Liz did quote a bit from it in her True Confessions years
														back, but full printing of Tickly Mince and its sequel
														fell through at the last minute.</span>

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks again for the
														script of your talk, which I&rsquo;ve just read. It was
														good to have the name of the slave-owner put to the
														inventory in the Judicial Records of Renfrewshire, which I
														happened to buy secondhand a couple of months ago, though
														I&rsquo;d had a look at it years back. Also interesting
														that Glasgow Courier aspect, which paper William
														Motherwell&mdash;about whom I mentioned I am writing for
														the DNB&mdash;took over as editor in 1830 until his death
														in 1835. Besides keeping the anti-abolitionist flames
														going it was of course hell for leather against the
														&ldquo;arch-agitator&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connell and his

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">When your book
														appears I&rsquo;ll want to buy one and would appreciate
														forewarning in case I miss it. You should let know David
														Dabydeen in the English Literature Dept at Warwick
														Unive&Ucirc;rsity. Perhaps you know his work anyway
														he&rsquo;s a poet from Guyana whose books of poetry have
														slavery business, his first one Slave Song and his third
														and most recent from Cape called Turner which is derived
														from Turner&rsquo;s 1840 painting &ldquo;Slavers throwing
														overboard the dead and dying&rdquo; which as Dabydeen
														points out in his preface, Ruskin described as showing
														&ldquo;the noblest sea...ever painted by man.&rdquo;
														He&rsquo;s also done some work I caught on tv about images
														of Black people in British Culture (obviously along the
														lines of the family portrait you mention) and has a book
														on that which I haven&rsquo;t seen. When I had David up at
														Paisley doing a reading when I was writer in residence
														there he made a few heavily ironic remarks during his
														performance about being invited to Scotland&mdash;and the
														influence in Guyana of Scottish culture as a result of the
														slave trade. </span><br />

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Another outlet your
														publisher should know of it it doesn&rsquo;t is the New
														Beacon Bookshop at 176 Stroud Green Road in London.
														Forgive me if this is all already known, but that&rsquo;s
														the shop run by John La Rose who this past few years was
														the founder and organiser of the Radical Black and Third
														World Bookfairs, which spread from London to other cities
														in England, and to Glasgow a couple of times. It&rsquo;s a
														great shop which would certainly be interested in your
														book. </span>

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I enclose a review of
														Roxy Harris&rsquo;s book written during a brief period
														when my face fitted at the Herald enough to be given
														reviews. Don&rsquo;t have any such place at the moment.
														Anyway it was good at this time, 1990, in passing to
														remind the douce readers of the origins of their City of

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Matt </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for your
														letter. I haven&rsquo;t heard anything from anyone about a
														cheque. That telephone number you mention: could you phone
														it? I don&rsquo;t know who is at that number and would
														rather not begin by having to ask there. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I also enclose the
														form you ask about. Since it&rsquo;s April 11th, the new
														tax year, I&rsquo;m not sure if it will still be the Arts
														Council, because the Writers in the Community scheme was
														taken over by Book Trust Scotland from the April 1st. It
														will depend on whom it was arranged with&mdash;it would
														have had to be previously arranged in advance otherwise
														they wouldn&rsquo;t wear it. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Enough of all that.
														On poetry matters a writer whom I am to my surprise
														finding a lot to enjoy in now that I&rsquo;m exploring the
														full range of his work, is Roy Campbell, the notorious
														Francoite who had his very public rows with MacDiarmid
														amongst many others, especially on the (especially English
														middle class) Left. There&rsquo;s a lot of work on
														Campbell has been done by Peter Alexander, not the Glasgow
														academic but an Australian one. Some of Campbell&rsquo;s
														stuff is crap but he&rsquo;s always totally engaged in his
														work, absolutely hated the whole English middle class
														literary scene, and some of his writing is really fine.
														He&rsquo;s as good a flyter&mdash;and always one sentence
														away from another outburst in his prose&mdash;as
														MacDiarmid himself. His grandparents were Scottish
														settlers in Natal. Alexander has written a good biography
														that sets the work in perspective. Do you know his work at
														all? I&rsquo;m reading his collected in four volumes, a
														South African publication that&rsquo;s in the university
														library. </span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hope you&rsquo;re
														enjoying Mauchline. I see from my Chambers Gazetteer that
														beside its Burns and Covenanting connections it &ldquo;has
														long been noted for its wooden snuffboxes and similar
														knicknacks.&rdquo; But that was 1895. &nbsp;</span><br />

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Here&rsquo;s the
														books promised. As I said, I&rsquo;ve spares, so
														you&rsquo;re welcome to them. In Radical Renfrew I think
														you might find the Chartist Edward Polin and the feminist
														Marion Bernstein interesting among others. With the
														railways now privatised it can seem quite relevant also
														something like &ldquo;After the Accident&rdquo; by the
														poet William (Inspector) Aitken. When I did a radio series
														on the books I remember having a lot of feeling over
														Aitken&rsquo;s line &ldquo;Did you ever hear of railways
														paying pensions to their men?&rdquo; My own father worked
														48 years in the railway, and retired on a pension (from
														the union) of ten bob&mdash;which the National Assistance
														docked off his rent allowance. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyway I know
														you&rsquo;ll be extremely busy, but nobody reads
														anthologies from end to end in any case. Quick dips in the
														book are intended to be made easier with the theme guide
														at the end of the introduction, xxxvii. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The second half of
														Reports from the Present has a deal of the stuff that was
														printed as a pro-strike booklet Satires and Profanities by
														the STUC during the miners&rsquo; strike. It&rsquo;s a
														pity that I didn&rsquo;t reprint the cover from that,
														three stick cartoons with the captions &ldquo;Did you hear
														about the Ulster D&rsquo;Oyley Carte Company?&rdquo;/
														&ldquo;They wanted to put on Trial by Jury .&rdquo;/
														&ldquo;They were arrested for conspiring to subvert the
														state.&rdquo; </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>

														Frankly I wish he was: I have already got to the point I
														had with Thatcher, of being unable to look, and lunging
														for the TV mute button. Soon it will be impossible to buy
														a newspaper, the way the Downing Street press office so
														appallingly efficiently manages daily, and weekly
														menu-planning. I suppose the rocket fired at the Cabinet
														office inevitably had to be outgunned one day with a
														&ldquo;twelve year old who wants peace&rdquo; at 10

														sided alone with America for full reintroduction of
														child-killing sanctions on Iraq. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">By the way, do you
														listen, or can you get in Edinburgh, Radio Ulster&rsquo;s
														daily noontime Talkback phone in, for an hour? Absolutely
														essential listening: the full range from collective
														religious psychosis, Book of Revelations and all, to sane
														decent people not being used as Sane Decent People for
														timely propaganda purposes. Real points of view in the
														full range being put: it&rsquo;s very moving sometimes,
														and really taking the lid off across the social divide in
														a way that I think is extremely important. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Glad, mightily at
														last, to see the back of Bruton, albeit he got his
														unionist parthian shot in with the decommissioning he
														agreed to, written in. That&rsquo;s the Blair government I
														understand, moving like lightning after Lurgan to
														Albright&rsquo;s America then on to Bruton. What other
														country would you hear striking a "sudden deal with
														another in the last hours of its government", without this
														being considered somewhat odd? Actually the whole Lurgan
														killings episode reminds me creepily of the
														&ldquo;Serbian&rdquo; massacre of the shoppers that was to
														the minute on cue to &ldquo;provoke&rdquo; the onslaught
														on the Serbs in Bosnia&mdash;despite subsequent reports in
														The Times that French and British observers denied the
														shell could have come from where the Nato-Americans said
														it had. Ahern has had his Reynolds hands tied, or
														that&rsquo;s the calculation it seems to me. He could
														hardly dissent, depending on the likes of Harney for his
														election in the Dail. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyway. There is

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for the
														cheque. Regarding the new Writers in Schools/Public
														situation, so much of the running of the scheme depends
														simply on the savvy of who&rsquo;s running it: Trevor
														Royle then Walter, and Shonagh of course throughout, put
														their commitment to the art and the artists before any
														commitment to the teachers and the schools-visit system. I
														don&rsquo;t sense that now in the publicity literature;
														nor in the circular to all writers sent in response to
														such as my own complaint about not being paid for
														readings, stating that &ldquo; a small problem&rdquo;
														(i.e. the nonpayment of writers) had arisen, but this was
														the fault of organisers, and would writers stop sending
														forms to Booktrust for readings they could not be paid
														for. In other words, the problem was that writers had
														begun to block the System with paper. Writers, please stop
														doing it. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I think as soon as
														the System is put under someone with the new title of
														Education Officer, then obviously it will
														super-efficiently fill up with writers of children&rsquo;s
														stories, those writers thought best suited for classroom
														teaching and the curriculum, the university lecturers,
														authors of a few books of course, who can give insight
														into how best to understand the canon on the way to the
														exam. Within the educational system there&rsquo;s an
														argument on behalf of that obviously, teachers need all
														the help they can get. But the person who decides to hold
														a small festival or lets-have-a-reading this summer, who
														thinking of a few months away, wants to get one or more
														writers&mdash;where is the scope for them? Put your
														tendering bid in next January to be told in March if you
														can have it the following year? Where the hell is the room
														for the sudden and necessary and living enthusiasms in
														that? The scheme now puts first and foremost and
														centrally, the system as it now runs, the educational
														system, with its year-on forward scheduling in the hands
														of certain teachers and schools. There will be some
														writers &amp; some almost-writers doing very well indeed
														by that, while others will be paying the price of a new
														exclusion. But the statistics will be better: and in a
														culture of underfunding, of systems run by
														&ldquo;officers&rdquo; &mdash; statistics come first. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Having said all that,

														interesting, although depressing as always, to see it from
														the language position, which is always the angle I
														can&rsquo;t help entering it. It&rsquo;s a nightmare
														linguistically to see the subeditors of the British press
														and their editors unanimously agree that the only possible
														language to write in is what they think of as
														&ldquo;poetic prose&rdquo;&mdash;which is to say the
														language of nineteenth century tombstones. The death of
														Mother Teresa last night has meant they&rsquo;ve had to

														block capitals. This morning they decided not to bother
														trying to get Mother Teresa on board, instead having an
														even longer headline, about fifty words, some homily from
														the Queen&rsquo;s special broadcast last night. Liz had
														been frogmarched to the BBC studios by the tabloids who
														had begun complaining that the Royals weren&rsquo;t
														joining in enough in the Nation&rsquo;s Grief. It&rsquo;s
														very much the Gulf War again as far as the Press are
														concerned, this time with a Saint instead of a Devil as
														focus. Again it&rsquo;s a reminder of basics to see the
														Guardian and the Independent down there on their knees
														pouring out the patriotic hellish language garbage with
														the rest of them. On Sunday Radio Four, Three and Five
														joined up for daylong raking over the ashes (sorry, wrong

														&ldquo;It was like seeing a bird in a cage which finds the

														to stay sane, enough to get lynched if it got into the
														real tabloids. Anyway, to healthier things, such as good

														quiet, it being the first day that the Scottish

												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your chapter about my
														own work is very cheering for me, but I&rsquo;d really
														like to be able to talk to you about your language
														discussion beyond that, which I think is really very
														interesting, and connects with something I have been
														trying to inch towards, as usual, about language as
														enclosure or not enclosure. So much of that is to do
														obviously with the position of the narrator, whether even
														word is supposed to stand in lieue of the world and all
														that sort of thing, colonialist so often in presumption.
														Your linear arrangement of voice makes the voices
														apparent, the rhythm: reminds me of Reznikoff oddly enough
														in his objectification of court transcripts, the voice as
														aesthetic evidence. Of course I&rsquo;m really interested
														in that, being one who has felt that the shape of
														authenticity is almost a kind of Platonic form
														thing&mdash; these people who think the world is enclosed
														in their word don&rsquo;t realise the structure of spacing
														and the rhythm, what is revealed by that, in people just
														trying in language to be honest with themselves, the
														presence of the person to the other person. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Which can sound a bit

														CD that came out (and fell down a bottomless unnoticed
														pit) about two months ago. The single surname title is a
														bit much, but what the bloke who runs AK wanted, to link
														it with other cover designs, and because he&rsquo;s very
														keen on my work. If huge numbers of Elmer Leonard or

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Here&rsquo;s my
														invoice. I&rsquo;m glad I was asked to do the workshop, as
														it went well, and I enjoyed meeting the people who
														attended. I almost pulled out before it to ask someone
														else to take my place, as I discussed with Julie, who gave
														me a lift. The truth is, I have realised, that I actually
														hate the term &ldquo;survivor&rdquo;, which I think is a
														bit of a blasphemy in the century of the holocaust, and
														that it is anyway the National Health Service that is in
														difficulty of surviving, if the term has to be used.
														Again, I had not realised, in giving poetry to
														&ldquo;Nomad&rdquo;, that the term could mean other than
														&ldquo;wanderer&rdquo;: I just hadn&rsquo;t conceived of
														such crassness and banality as could put forward a word
														capable of being translated as, &ldquo;Look, we are not
														mad.&rdquo; Jesus: no wonder I feel as if I&rsquo;ve been
														bounced into supposedly being somebody who&rsquo;s
														&ldquo;come out&rdquo; as having been &ldquo;in&rdquo;.
														What is really angering about that, is the thought of the
														kind of patronising well paid idiot who can now evidently
														presume to look at my work in this wholly misconstrued
														light. Hell, I want nothing to do with this kind of
														nonsense. As regards anyone having had psychiatry, if they
														ever had, so what: if they were a rich bastard in New York
														they could jog down for their weekly mental workout with
														their analyst, without making themselves supposedly the
														public prey of benignity-in-anticipation, from
														&ldquo;careworkers&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not referring to your
														own part in this, but the position to be patronised that
														people are being put in, such as at the Tryst reading, is
														I think genuinely awful. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I&rsquo;m just a
														writer, Larry, fuck all else. And my work is the product
														of writing, fuck all else. What was good, anyway, about
														last night&rsquo;s workshop, was that all the
														&ldquo;survivor&rdquo; stuff had to go and take a running
														fuck to itself. It was made clear we were there about
														writing, nothing to do with anything else. So it was a
														good night. </span><br />

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Charles
														(King)&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Will just dash this
														off to you before Sonya and I head off for a swim. Have
														been trying to keep the swimming going
														recently&mdash;there&rsquo;s the local pool down at
														George&rsquo;s Cross, an excellent smallish pool that is
														really much used by the community, it&rsquo;s great to see
														all the different types and ages and disabled people at
														different times; and a new large pool as part of a sports
														complex opened at Scotstounhill. It&rsquo;s a great place,
														you feel like your going into an Olympic village visiting
														it (though that makes me feel a right fraud); but we have
														only recently discovered that it is on the 44 bus route
														that goes past our door, so we hope to start using that
														pool for a while. For myself it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m
														trying to recover my youth or some nonsense, just that
														particularly as winter comes in, it&rsquo;s sensible to
														try to make the most of facilities like these
														pools&mdash;they&rsquo;re really a great public asset,
														indispensable in so many ways. It&rsquo;s really
														depressing when you hear of facilities like this getting
														closed because of cuts, such as at Govan. On the other
														hand it&rsquo;s great that the ones that are there do
														exist, and are for general public use.&nbsp; </span><span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Am glad to hear your
														striding over the golf links so much. Some day we must
														have a game in Glasgow or Aberdeen. I must warn you that
														the last time I played many years ago, my handicap was not
														a great deal smaller than the course par. But we could
														enjoy the walk. When I grew up in Pollok our local golf
														course was the council one at Deaconsbank near Rouken
														Glen.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I am really looking
														forward to Colorado in a few weeks. Not the
														journey&mdash;Glasgow-Amsterdam-Detroit-Denver&mdash; but
														certainly seeing all the places mentioned in Chapter
														Thirteen of my Thomson book. Apparently Central City,
														where Thomson was based for six months in 1873, was
														preserved by and large as the old mining town that it was,
														until recently. However about ten years ago the gambling
														laws were changed to allow gaming parlours, machines etc.
														So it now looks just like any other gambling hell on
														earth. I can&rsquo;t think of anything more
														soul-destroying than a gambling town. I cannot understand
														another person&rsquo;s interest in gambling: admission to
														hell I&rsquo;m sure will be by lottery ticket. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyway Charles
														I&rsquo;ll just finish this as we&rsquo;re going for a
														bus. I have recently set up a small cassette in the
														kitchen where some of your tapes have been giving much
														pleasure during meals and washings up recenlty. That
														wonderful tape of the John Field nocturnes. And Sonya
														loves the Bjorling cassette. I have not read a newspaper
														or listened to a news bulletin since the Princess of Wales
														funeral. The last straw I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;I have been
														engaged in a rather rigorous language detoxification
														programme. More on that another time. Keep in touch.</span><br />

														style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">You can have
														permission to use what you want, though I have to say that
														I don&rsquo;t actually agree with the way you are using
														it. "Honest" is not a short story, and this satire on the
														earnestness of the attitudes it contains (and part mock
														tribute to Beckett&rsquo;s great prose) was written in
														1970, which is to say three years after Six Glasgow Poems,
														which is to say long before I ever read Archie
														Hind&rsquo;s book, and nothing whatever to do with
														&ldquo;the Seventies&rdquo; and its alleged new Glasgow
														dialect fightback. There are things in Archie&rsquo;s
														book&mdash;an important one&mdash; I really admire, but
														the passage you make much of I found deplorable when I got
														round to reading the novel, a cul de sac of the
														narrator&rsquo;s own making, from a wrongly digested
														notion of culture. The trouble with the way you are using
														my work&mdash;though it is not uncommon
														academically&mdash;is that you are making logic out of
														what is being ironically satirised, to develop a straight
														line of development that not only isn&rsquo;t actually
														there, but is being sent up in its absence. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sandy Hamilton wrote
														&ldquo;Gallus did you say&rdquo; etc specifically to use
														in schools, I seem to remember him saying, which is
														nothing to do with the way my own work operates. He is not
														&ldquo;following any line&rdquo; of mine, to put it
														mildly, and the line you have construed, in my opinion,
														not only doesn&rsquo;t actually exist in my own work, but
														is satirised therein. </span><br />

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Robert&nbsp; </span><span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for the
														proofs. You do retain &ldquo;Vergil&rdquo; in the proof
														though your letter says I had you with the spelling and
														you only found out &ldquo;it was really Virgil&rdquo; a
														couple of weeks ago. Well, so long as you don&rsquo;t
														change my copy... Vergil is in fact given as a spelling
														variant in for example Collins Twentieth Century
														Dictionary, and comes up in, looking at a biblio, eg
														Nettleship&rsquo;s Ancient Lives of Vergil (1880),
														Conway&rsquo;s Harvard Lectures on the Vergilian Age
														(1931), De Witt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vergil and
														Epicureanism&rdquo; in the Classical Weekly (Vol XXV,
														1932), Wili&rsquo;s Vergil ( Munich 1930); not forgetting
														Rehm&rsquo;s Das geographische Bild des alten Italien in
														Vergils Aeneis (Leipzig 1932) and from the Holy
														Pontiff&rsquo;s big cupboard under the stairs, Fragmenta
														et picturae Vergiliani codicis Vaticani 3225 (=F) Rome,
														1899.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Et cetera. The point
														in using this spelling is to give it a slightly pompous
														deliberately misplaced pedantry, as in those who know fuck
														all about music but will insist on talking about Ludwig
														van Beethoven, rather than just Beethoven. The voice in
														the line in my poem has a slightly ironic pomposity, for
														specific contextual reason, as one who knows about P.
														Vergilius Maximus, as encountered on certain pages by
														cognescenti. All meant to be subliminal of course, just
														raised to the light in clearings-up like this. &nbsp;</span><span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"> <br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for your font
														work with 100 differences, teacup, dictionary, access, old

													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dear Ed&nbsp; </span><span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">My attempts to write
														a poem about my trip to Colorado like you asked, had me
														thinking along my book&rsquo;s lines of the New Jerusalem
														as antidote to the basis of the industrial city,
														Thomson&rsquo;s Irvingite mother&rsquo;s hopes and her
														son&rsquo;s reply in the poem, reply and exposition and
														analysis, as it is. Revelations, and the city on the hill.
														Central City is such an exposition in its own way, in the
														lap of the mountains, and the basicness of the tearing at
														the mountain to set up the place, or rather to set up and
														bolster the institutions of the big places elsewhere.
														Capitalism founded on the mining of raw materials, with
														singleminded men competing for it.&nbsp; </span><span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is so apposite
														that it is now a gambling town. I&rsquo;ve written
														elsewhere that among the numerous ways of looking at the
														poem some people might see &ldquo; the world of the
														Redundant Male abandoned to urban industrial darkness,
														having in the name of "progress" banished the Female, and
														the Organic. Others will picture a lonely universe of male
														repetitive-compulsive behaviour; of men who have rejected
														a God obsessed with sex and physical retribution - but who
														have found that self-diagnosis is not the same as cure and
														release; and whose lapses into compulsion can be seen as
														the private rituals of a futile quest.&rdquo;&nbsp; </span><span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It&rsquo;s certainly
														a place of private ritual now, still searching for that
														lost thread. It was apposite that Jane [Wodening] and I
														left just as darkness was coming down, and that as we came
														speeding down the hill both Jupiter and Venus were
														visible&mdash;in fact the two planets were for a while the
														only two night objects visible&mdash;in a gap between
														mountains. It was exhilarating, given the Promethean
														male/female address at the opening to Places of the
														Mind.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The work for a poem
														with aforesaid ingredients was too ideas-led. The attached
														poster-poem came through separately, then I saw the
														Colorado connections, and hope you think it&rsquo;s ok to
														send you it. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ll want it
														for the cotton print you mentioned: if you do, the
														typefaces I have used are: &ldquo;a&rdquo;&mdash;Times
														Italic Outline Shadow 54 pt; next 6 lines Times Italic
														Outline Shadow 48 pt; the institution of the

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for the book
														you sent a few weeks ago. I had hoped that Nicholas would
														have had the new Raworth/Griffiths/Leonard volume out by
														Christmas, but the publisher messed up the line alignment
														of some of the pages, so it will have to be rebound in

												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Reading your own
														there, &ldquo;Erskine of Linlathen&rdquo; brings me back
														to our conversation at Eldon Street ages ago, though the
														poem itself for me has also some connection with the
														movements of the poems in the new collection that
														you&rsquo;ve sent. The line &ldquo;the heart longing to
														hear in answer&rdquo; also reminds me of the opening pages
														of Buber&rsquo;s Between Man and Man, which opening I have
														always thought an arresting beginning. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Yes it would be good
														if we could meet when you&rsquo;re in Glasgow, it&rsquo;s
														a pity we have not met for such a while. We could have a
														coffee, maybe a walk up by the river nearby if the weather
														permits. I would wel&Icirc;come that very much.&nbsp; </span><span
														style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In November I was
														over in Colorado, my first time in America. The invitation
														was to Boulder, where I gave a reading and talked about
														Radical Renfrew and Thomson, and stayed a few days with Ed
														and Jenny Dorn. The highlight for me was getting to see
														Central City, where Thomson was in 1872 whilst halfway
														through writing &ldquo;The City of Dreadful Night&rdquo;.
														The place hasn&rsquo;t changed all that much
														architecturally, and the visit was really amazing for me.
														Ed was pretty heroic in being as hospitable as he was,
														he&rsquo;s very ill with cancer and it&rsquo;s a difficult
														time for Jenny and himself. </span><br />
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>
													<span style="font-size: 10pt;">He asked me to write
														a poem about my visit: what I have come up with, enclosed,
														is a not in the form I expected to produce, but you take
														what you get. Also a triptych done about a week ago: I see
														it to be viewed as a vertical column, with a space between
														the individual bits equal to about a page. Top one text,
														middle the slashed-across, bottom one the rectangle. Keep
														in touch.</span><br />
