												<p>A letter to my publisher recently concluded a
													paragraph with the following which continued to have me
													thinking:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>God how comfy the armchairs of identity beckon to
														some especially as they grow old and tired of walking. My
														walking is not done ha ha</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													It reminds me of years ago when my father had a stroke and
													was taken into hospital where he never spoke again but lay
													for a number of weeks before he died. We visited talking to
													him nightly just in the hope that he could understand, as I
													think he did. It was in January and a miserable experience
													getting the bus out each night and back often it seemed in
													the rain. When I came home I sometimes would sit on my own
													for a while and seemed to find some kind of comfort in
													Richard Tauber’s great 1927 recording of Schubert’s <em>Die
														Winterreise.</em> The recording has Tauber singing 12 of the 24
													songs, the one which then seemed to carry the most
													resonance being “Das Wirthaus” in which the solitary
													traveller comes to a graveyard and hopes for some
													accommodation there, but there too all the accommodation is
													already taken. The last two of the four verses are thus:

												</p>
												<p>
													A slightly restricted transfer of Tauber singing “Das
													Wirthaus” can be heard on YouTube <a

													 primary work from conception to completed article of my
													last four books is perhaps not recognised and I think it
													ought to be, without him the books simply wouldn't be
													there; the details of his solitary toils to get them to
													fruition from a life that is neither cushy nor moneyed is
													another matter for another day. Just another story from the
													smallpress progressive poetry history. An excellent
													solitary publisher with whom I am very happy to be
													associated in my work and personal life.

												<p>I am sorry to report that the terminal boredom I have
													been suffering from regarding the so-called “independence
													debate” has now reached critical proportions. As I
													mentioned at my booklaunch on Friday last it almost
													surprised me I was still alive six months after terminal
													boredom had set in.</p>
												<p>Remedy is abstention. I intend to avoid on the
													subject all radio and television programmes, conferences
													and their reports, studio debates, published statements of
													personal position, newspaper articles and comment columns
													to the power a thousand, minceheads from Westminster
													droning on about “the union”, yes-vote persons endlessly
													and cavalierly describing those not on their side as
													“unionists”.</p>
												<p>I am interested in politics, that I know. In fact, I
													think that is actually the problem with my boredom. I don’t
													expect many of the above to understand that.</p>

												<p>If you think you’re not getting enough news about
													Scotland of actual significance from its newspapers or
													electronic media, maybe you’re not casting your newsnet
													wide enough. Nato is so central to the foreign policy heart
													of Labour, Tory, LibDem and SNP party members, you would
													think they would be boasting about Nato’s training exercise
													“Joint Warrior” that’s been taking place in Scottish waters
													this past week. After all it’s been the biggest exercise in
													the twice-yearly series to date with 40 warships, 40 fixed
													wing aircraft, 30 helicopters, and no less than 12,000
													military personnel taking part in such as mock landings on
													hostile bits of ehm, Carnoustie.</p>
												<p>All this for the “Response Force Task Group” which
													can be sent at short notice bombing and fighting anywhere
													in the world when it gets the nod. So that’s all right.
													Nothing there that will be affected by the referendum.
													Thanks Alex.</p>

													In a talk I gave two years ago on R D Laing and Beckett at
													the Mitchell Library in Glasgow, I came to the conclusion
													that whilst Laing’s <em>The Divided Self</em> of 1960 was
													one of the great books of the twentieth century, his <em>The
														Politics of Experience</em> seven years later was one of the
													most irresponsible. <em>The Divided Self</em> had laid bare
													the nature of microstructural complicity by which two
													persons in power can form the given sides of a relationship
													triangle functioning to deny full personhood to a subject
													colonised third. <em>The Politics of Experience </em>on the
													other hand almost certainly caused sundry personal
													tragedies through its implicit romanticisation of psychosis
													as rebirthing authentic inner journey that could take place
													in an outwardly insane society. The psychologically
													vulnerable reading the book were in a very dangerous space.
												</p>
												<p>
													Laing left the army in 1953 and took up his first job in
													Gartnavel Royal psychiatric hospital in Glasgow. A book he
													is likely to have been made aware of at the time had been
													republished six years earlier in 1947:<em>The
														Philosophy of Insanity, by a Late Inmate of the Glasgow
														Royal Asylum for Lunatics at Gartnavel. </em>The book itself
													dated its first publication from the late 1850’s, and
													contained an account from 1843 of a psychotic breakdown
													which I have to say I find contains more honest sanity of
													overall outlook—where sanity = health — than Laing’s 1967
													publication.
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>I purpose to note down a few of my
														recollections concerning my thoughts and actions while
														under the influence of the disease, in the hope that they
														may be useful to those whose business it is to watch over
														the insane, and a warning to those who through ignorance
														or recklessness abuse their minds till the tortured
														spirit, like a fire-begirt scorpion, turns upon itself and
														stings.</strong>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>One night, after a number of weeks of
														fearful suffering, as I was lying in bed tossing,
														sleepless and despairing, a most horrible impulse seized
														upon me, an impulse impelling me to destroy one who of all
														living beings, most deserved my love. I buried myself
														under the bedclothes and struggled with the hellish
														impulse till the bed shook. It still gained strength. I
														sprang up, clung to the bedpost and sank my teeth, in the
														agony of despair, into the hard wood. It was
														uncontrollable. I shut my eyes, bowed down my head for
														fear that I should see her, and rushed out of the house.
														Barefooted, with no covering save a nightshirt, I ran
														through the streets to the Police Station and implored
														them to lock me up. Fortunately the officer on duty was a
														humane and sensible man. He gave me a watch-coat to wrap
														around me, kept me under his own eye, and, I suppose, sent
														notice to my friends, for my wife and sister came with
														clothing. The paroxysm had passed, and, gasping, panting
														for death in any form, I accompanied them home, steeped to
														the lips in despair.</strong>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>I had a little sickly boy, a special
														favourite on account of his helplessness; and after I was
														removed to the Asylum, night and day the weeping and
														wailing of that child rang around me, and the cry, “I’m
														hungry, father, I’m hungry,” scorched my heart like fire.
														This, to me, soul-harrowing cry broke down what little
														reason I had remaining; and when my wife came to see me, I
														insisted on taking my clothes off to give her to sell for
														food for the children. I inquired wildly for that child;
														she told me he was at home and well. How could I believe
														her, when I heard him distinctly while she spoke, sobbing
														and crying, “I’m hungry, father, I’m hungry.” I became
														convinced that the child was in the Asylum, although I
														could not see him; and I was in the constant practice of
														putting a portion of my food at every meal into a corner,
														in the hope that he might fall in with it in his
														wanderings. His voice became weaker; and then the wail
														changed to— “My father does not care for me now.” The
														whole of my food was laid into corners for him now— I
														could not taste it. This was allowed to go on until it was
														evident that it would end in death, and then I was shut up
														in a room by myself, and food of the most savoury
														description offered me and left with me. I tried to take
														it, when — “I’m hungry, father, I’m hungry,” from that now
														weak, dying infant voice, again pierced through my soul. I
														felt the blood rushing to my head —flames seemed to issue
														from my eyes, and then comes a blank in memory’s book, the
														only blank that in all my sufferings I have ever known.</strong>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>I have reason to think that about a
														fortnight elapsed before memory awoke from that death-like
														slumber. How I behaved during that time I never knew; but
														the first thing I remember was awakening as out of a
														horrible dream. I think they had been trying what cold and
														darkness would do for me, for I was chilled to the marrow,
														and the place was dark. I thought to myself, without
														speaking, how long have I been here, when instantly a
														voice within me replied, “a thousand years.” Impossible; I
														could not live so long, I thought, when the voice again
														replied, “thou shalt never die.” The idea of never dying
														struck more terror to my soul than ever the sentence of
														death did to the veriest coward that ever crawled and
														crouched and begged to live. I thought I saw a chink in
														the wall through which light was streaming. It was
														imagination, for it must have been a solid wall. I looked
														through it, and there was a paved court with stables all
														round and troop horses tied to rings in the wall. Some
														soldier-like men were grooming them, while others were
														cleaning carabines, holster pistols, and swords. I knew
														now, what I had before suspected, that the Asylum was a
														barrack for banditti—the pretended patients a brand of
														brigands, and that there was not an insane or an honest
														man in the establishment. This idea continued for a long
														time in full force, and I had not got rid of it when I
														left the Asylum. It received rather a startling
														confirmation the first day, I think it was, after I was
														brought down from seclusion. They were at that time
														furnishing the west house, and two or three carts of
														furniture were driven past the window of the gallery in
														which I was placed. I recognised this at once as plunder
														and could distinctly see a number of valuable articles
														belonging to a friend of mine who resided at no great
														distance from the Asylum.</strong>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>To many a day of agony did that delusion
														doom me, for I was in terror for the fate of any friend
														who came to inquire for or to visit me; and the very
														communicative spirit which had now taken permanent
														lodgings within me assured me that if I gave my wife or
														any other friend the slightest hint about the character of
														the place, they would never be permitted to leave the
														Asylum alive. Had it not been for this, I would have
														positively prohibited my wife from visiting me, although I
														knew that by so doing I would have opened the floodgates
														of utter despair. These visits were the “be all and end
														all” of my existence; and perhaps, assisted by the agony
														thus mingled with them, kept my spirit alive and saved it
														from sinking into that death of the intellect, idiocy.
														Many a dark hint I gave her; and one time after she left
														me the idea that I had spoken too plainly and that they
														had killed her in consequence, roused me into madness
														again. What a fearful week of sleepless suffering. Could I
														have got at that magazine of gunpowder which I believed
														these robbers had stowed away in the cellars under the
														Asylum, how eagerly would I have applied the match which
														would have blown us all to destruction. My wife, however,
														came on the appointed day as usual, and brought the child
														with her, whose hunger-stricken cry had so tortured me. He
														had been in the country and had greatly improved in health
														and appearance; and as the little fellow clung round my
														neck and kissed me, I could not help thinking that he
														could not have been quite so hungry as he had said. It
														would appear that nothing short of the utter destruction
														of itself can satisfy the insane mind; for they had not
														long left till I fancied that the child was still in the
														Asylum, and that he had been fattened up by some infernal
														process for the purpose of deceiving me and that his
														mother had been compelled to join in the conspiracy
														against her child and me.</strong>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>I often could not get sleep, nor even get
														attempting to try to sleep, for that spirit which had
														taken up lodgings in my stomach, replying to every thought
														and most pertinaciously insisting that I should listen
														while it read to me out of a book, the words of which
														alternately fell cold as haildrops on my brain or flowed
														upon it like a stream of molten fire. Strange to say,
														circumstances which could only have been seen or known by
														me in infancy, and of which I was entirely ignorant but
														which, by after inquiry, I found to be true, were mingled
														with the most horrible lies. The truths must have lain
														forgotten and illegible in some dark corner of the brain
														till lighted up and rendered readable by the wild glare
														which madness throws on everything around. Stung to the
														quick by a fearful lie which he was reading about my
														father, I demanded the name of the book. “It is the
														text-book of hell, the bible of the damned,” was the
														instant reply. After this, let him do as he liked, I would
														listen no more to him or his book; and by perservering in
														this, the entire delusion slowly faded away.</strong>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>During the whole period of my residence in
														the Asylum, my wife visited me upon a stated day each
														week; and except at the time of my seclusion, when she
														told me that I was too ill to be seen, no week passed
														without her seeing me. During a portion of the time she
														had to travel from Rutherglen seven miles distant from the
														Asylum. There was no conveyance between these places those
														days; yet, let the day be ever so stormy, there she was,
														true as the sun to her time. To this, to her I owe my
														preservation from suicide or idiocy. These visits gave me
														something to think upon, they were, as it were, a solid
														spot in a troubled ocean whereon the spirit could
														occasionally rest. Often when I felt mad feeling arising
														or a cold icy feeling of stupor creeping over my brain, I
														have been soothed or roused by the thought of seeing her
														and hearing from my children, my love for whom madness had
														only inflamed. Before the close of my confinement I
														believed that all my children were in the Asylum, and I
														heard their different voices under the floor, screaming to
														me to save them from tortures which I dare not name. It
														would have required a brain of brass to have withstood
														this; mine was never composed of any such material, and I
														would stand motionless as a statue for hours, feeling
														little, thinking little, and only possessed by a dreamy
														consciousness that I existed; and then a cry of agony from
														some much-loved voice would ring through my brain like the
														last trumpet sounding the resurrection, then instantly
														that corpse-like form was raging with mad life and that
														dark mental sepulchre was gleaming bright with fires that
														glowed like hell.</strong>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>My wife saw that recovery was getting more
														hopeless— that I was getting absent and stupid; in plain
														terms, that I was sinking into idiocy, and she at once
														determined to try to save me, let the consequences be what
														they would. In the face of the earnest remonstrance of the
														physician belonging at that time to the Establishment—who
														had a bad opinion of my case from the first—who assured
														her that I was dangerous, and the advice, almost the
														threatenings of relations, she took me home, not in
														ignorance nor recklessness, for she knew that there was
														danger and was calmly prepared to meet it. She told me
														since that she never expected I would be much use in
														providing for the family; but that she intended me, when I
														was a little more settled, to take care of the house and
														children while she wrought at a business which she
														followed before our marriage for our support.</strong>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>Although very unsettled for some weeks, so
														much so that any one possessed of less love or firmness
														than her would assuredly have sent me back to the Asylum,
														the change and the society of my family saved me; and
														although for a considerable time not quite fitted for the
														duties of the situation, a true friend, a cousin of my
														own, gave me employment, and instead of finding fault with
														my shortcomings encouraged me to perservere; and thus
														although I have always been willing to act as nurse to her
														babies, she never yet has been required to work for their
														support; nor has she ever rued the day on which she took
														her poor insane husband by the hand and walked off with
														him from among the doctors who, I have no doubt, thought
														her own sanity a little doubtful.</strong>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<strong>This subject is to me decidedly painful,
														but I do hope that my treatment of it may be a means of
														encouraging friends to persevere in their attention to
														relatives who are thus afflicted; and in this hope I have
														told my plain truthful story, and who knows but that it
														may soften the prejudices which almost everyone entertains
														against such as I; and I may add, for the consolation of
														the afflicted and their friends, that a fit of insanity
														does not necessarily permanently injure either the
														feelings or the intelligence of the person, after the fit
														has passed. For myself, I can truly say that my entire
														mind was clearer and stronger—my conduct more rational,
														and my imagination, naturally very strong, more under
														control after my recovery than it had ever been during any
														former period of my existence. Still, I suspect that grief
														or disappointment, irregularity of living, especially want
														of sleep, may have a greater tendency to induce mental
														derangement in such than if they had never been thus
														afflicted. This is merely a supposition, but that they
														belong to the nervous class subject to this disease is a
														certainty; and as they thus carry one part of the disease
														within them, they should be doubly careful to avoid all
														things tending to produce unhealthy mental excitement
														which, in their case, is all that is wanting to produce
														another attack.</strong>

												<p>There is a Scrap Trident demo taking place in Glasgow

													<strong>April 12th</strong>
												</p>
												<p>It’s one thing to have a nationalist movement against
													a foreign power using an army of occupation, as was the
													case in sundry British colonies. But the only army of
													occupation in Scotland consists of Scottish soldiers home
													on leave from Afghanistan. The economic and political
													stratum members of which sold Scottish sovereignty three
													hundred years ago will remain as firmly ensconced after any
													poll on “independence”, no matter what the result. So much
													for the “give us back our country” cry. Who is the “us”,
													who is the “we”?</p>
												<p>
													Which means, who and which is the “self” when the 2014
													referendum issue is guised as an issue of  “self
													determination”, as if this was a more authentic and
													fundamental alternative to mere “nationalism”.  It isn’t,
													and it can’t be so long as the "self" is undefined. If it
													is to say it is “the self of the country”, “the people” as
													to say “the Scottish people” etc., then we have to define
													what we mean by Scottish; which goes straight to the
													prescriptive versus descriptive mode, which in the
													nationalist binary comes out as “pure Scots” versus what
													Sturgeon when challenged calls “inclusive civic
													nationalism.” Because when one actually examines the “self
													determination” mode <em>via the proposed Scottish
														referendum</em> on independence, it is nationalism, be it
													prescriptive or descriptive, that comes out top in the
													wash.
												</p>
												<p>If it is from within the context of the referendum
													one is speaking, the proposal that it is about
													self-determination not nationalism is delusion; one gladly
													pumped by nationalists seeking the active help of many who
													would not want to be defined as nationalists: who might
													distrust it for many reasons, not least its predilection to
													racism. Self determination, even “independence” can be a
													respectable ideal. But for me it must involve a different
													type of "self", and a different type of "independence",
													than that which this nationalist-sponsored and initiated
													Scottish referendum has to offer.</p>

													From a notebook: <em>Clare not a social poet like
														Burns. What I have loved in Clare is the tenderness of an
														isolated individual being with an observed part of nature,
														and letting one as a reader be with him in the observing.
														Burns is never an isolated figure in this sense, but
														always part of a social structure: even the ploughman
														turning up the mouse’s nest is at work, part of the social
														structure of employment and exchange. Clare on the other
														hand lies about in the fields and woods, he is not in any
														employment, never “going about his business”. Burns does
														not shape an interior monologue which he hands over to be
														the interior monologue of the reader. Clare does this, to
														an extent at any rate: one becomes an isolated reader
														reading Clare, one’s separateness is a given. Not so with
														Burns.</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													<em>For Clare then in a way there is a kind of social
														structure between writer and reader. In Burns the social
														structure is already in place beyond the page, and he is
														part of it. You are too, or you aren’t.</em>
