												<p>An isolated summary of the phoney “news” sources and
													other matters for the Syria situation miraculously got
													through last week to the mainstream, not that it stopped or
													will stop the relentless outpouring from same being
													faithfully and hourly reproduced everywhere.</p>
												<p>Actually there were two “Syrian Observatory for Human
													Rights” bods, but they fell out with each other. I remember
													one of them photographed with William Hague early on.
													Qatari money, everywhere just now from Al-Jazeera’s Nato
													Broadcasting Company to the new “Shard” monument to the
													Emir in London.</p>
												<p>The template with the whole palette of ingredients
													much as in Libya and in Iraq before it, and as will in due
													course continue in Iran. I gave up getting involved in blow
													by blow replies after Libya, it would be a fulltime job and
													I have other things to do, like staying sane. The much
													touted example of journalistic integrity the late Maria
													Colvin kind of summed it up when she visited the
													Nato-devastated ruins of the once populous town of Sirte
													and managed to come up with the news that Gaddafi
													apparently had worn silk shirts.</p>
												<p>

												<p>Had a couple of days’ break this week in North
													Berwick, enjoying walking along the shore and listening to
													as it happened retreating waves breaking on the sand; that
													sense of the uniquely relaxing fundamental, picked up from
													the last time, that that sound can bring to a visiting
													urbanite like myself.</p>
												<p>
													North Berwick was a town visited by the poet Alexander
													Wilson in September 1789 when he was travelling the coast
													east of Edinburgh selling goods as a pedlar and trying to
													interest people in subscribing to his first book, <em>Poems,
													</em>which appeared a year later. Four years on again and Wilson
													had fled Scotland for America. Jailed in his local town of
													Paisley more than once for poetry naming and shaming a
													local corrupt businessman, he had finally jumped bail when
													awaiting trial for “being concerned in framing and
													industriously circulating an advertisement addressed to The
													Friends of Liberty and Reform.”  The leading light at the
													time in the Friends of the People, the great Scottish
													radical Thomas Muir, had just been sentenced to
													transportation for fourteen years, and his ship set sail
													for Botany Bay on May 1st 1794. It was better for Alexander
													Wilson at least to set sail out of Scotland of his own
													volition and to a destination of his own choice.
													Accordingly with nephew William Duncan he walked to
													Portpatrick in southwest Scotland from where they sailed to
													Belfast; and from there took ship for America, Wilson
													writing back to his parents in July 1794 with an account of
													the journey.
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>We sailed in the ship “Swift,” from Belfast Loch,
														on Friday the 23<sup>rd</sup> of May, about six in the
														morning...  We had 350 passengers—a mixed multitude of
														men, women, and children. Each berth between decks was
														made to hold them all, with scarce a foot for each. At
														first sight I own, it appeared to me almost impossible
														that one half of them could survive; but, on looking
														around, and seeing some whom I thought not much stouter
														than myself, I thought I might have a chance as well as
														the rest or some of them. I asked Willy if he was willing,
														and he saying he was, we went up to Belfast immediately
														for our clothes; and in two days after we got on board,
														she sailed.
													</em>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>We were very sick for four days, but soon
														recovered; and having a good, steady, fair breeze  for
														near a fortnight, had hopes of an excellent voyage. On the
														third day, and just as we had lost sight of land, we spoke
														the Caledonia of Greenock, a letter of marque, bound for
														the Bay of Fundy; on Monday following, Dr Reynolds, who
														was tried and condemned by the Irish House of Lords, was
														discovered to be on board, and treated all the passengers
														and crew with rum-grog, which we drank to the confusion of
														despots, and the prosperity of liberty the world over.
														Till the 17<sup>th</sup> of June we had pretty good
														weather, and only buried an old woman and two children. On
														the 18<sup>th</sup>, we fell in with an amazing number of
														islands of ice; I counted at one time more than
														thirty-four in sight, some of whom that we nearly passed
														were more than twice as high as our main top-gallant
														mast-head, and of great extent; we continued passing among
														them, with a good breeze, for two days, during which time
														we ran at least five knots an hour. On the 20<sup>th</sup>
														we had a storm of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning,
														beyond anything I had ever witnessed. Next day a seaman
														dropped overboard; and, though he swam well and made for
														the ship, yet the sea running high, and his clothes
														getting wet he perished within six yards of a hen-coop,
														which he had thrown over to him. On the 11<sup>th</sup>
														July we could plainly perceive land from the mast-head;
														but a terrible gale of wind blowing all night from the
														shore, it was Sunday before we again had the satisfaction
														of seeing it, scarcely perceptible through the fog; but a
														pilot coming on board, and the sun rising, we found
														ourselves within the Capes of Delaware—the shore on land
														having the appearance of being quite flat, and only a
														complete forest of trees.
													</em>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>About seven at night, having had a good breeze all
														day, we cast anchor at a place called Reedy Island, where
														one of the cabin passengers, and the first man who had
														leapt ashore in the long-boat, was drowned in returning to
														the ship. We arrived at Newcastle the next day about
														mid-day, where we were all as happy as mortals could be;
														and being told that Wilmington was only five miles up
														river, we set out on foot through a flat woody country,
														that looked in every respect like a new world to us, from
														the great profusion of fruits that everywhere overhung our
														heads, the strange birds, shrubs &amp;c., and came at
														length to Wilmington, which lies on the side of a hill,
														about a mile from the Delaware, and may be about as large
														as Renfrew, or perhaps larger.</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													Wilson’s subsequent life in America, and his travels over
													thousands of miles by horse, foot and canoe between 1804
													and 1812 compiling his pioneering nine-volume <em>Ornithology</em>
													illustrating and describing the birds of America, forms one
													of the great personal tales of a life fully spent. It can
													be read in his journals and letters that complement his
													poems. There is a resumé of his life with short selection
													of his poems in <em>Radical Renfrew.</em>

													<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The
															Memorial and Vera Brittain</span></strong>
												</p>
												<p> </p>
												<p>The service programme at the unveiling of the
													memorial to Bomber Command last Thursday listed three
													“philanthopic entrepeneurs” as the principal funders of the
													6½ million pound project. These were billionaires John
													Caudwell “Lord” Michael Ashcroft, and Richard Desmond.</p>
												<p>
													Caudwell made his fortune as Mr <em>Phones4U</em>, and in
													2005 was fined millions of pounds by HMRC for illegally
													avoiding tax using the Employee Benefit Trust scam for
													which now-liquidated Glasgow Rangers are under
													investigation. “Lord” Michael Ashcroft  was drafted into
													the House of Lords in 2000 by William Hague, though he
													payed no income tax in Britain as he was not a domiciled
													resident in the UK. His main philanthropic activity in
													Britain seems to have been pouring money from his untaxed
													wealth in Belize into Conservative Party funds in marginal
													constituencies at election time, for which when criticised
													he said simply that it was not illegal. The third
													“philanthropic entrepeneur”, Richard Desmond,  owner of
													Express Newspapers OK magazine and Channel 5, in 2004 tried
													to buy the British <em>Daily Telegraph</em>. When told at a
													meeting with <em>Telegraph </em>executives that the paper
													was on offer to the German publisher Axelrod, his outburst
													against Germans as a people and the <em>Telegraph</em> for
													dealing with them led one executive to state "It was the
													most grotesque outburst of a mix of slander and racism that
													I have ever been subjected to. If it had been in a public
													place he would have been arrested."
												</p>
												<p>
													The ceremony at the unveiling of the memorial by the Queen
													was broadcast on BBC television live on Thursday at noon,
													then followed at 5pm with an hour-long repeat under the
													title “Tribute to Bomber Command”; then repeated again at
													11pm, then broadcast yet again the following day on BBC
													Hard Drive channel at 11pm. But Bomber Command was not
													always the subject of tribute, even during the war. On
													November 28<sup>th</sup> 1943 George Bernard Shaw wrote to
													the <em>Daily Express </em>“The blitzing of the cities has
													carried this war to such a climax of infernal atrocity that
													all recrimination on that score are ridiculous. The Germans
													will have as big a bill of atrocities against us as we
													against them if we take them into an impartial court.” In <em>Seed
														of Chaos: What Mass Bombing Really Means</em>, published a
													year <em>before</em> the bombing of Dresden, Vera Brittain
													wrote: “The number killed by German air raids on Britain
													from the beginning of the War up to October 31<sup>st</sup>,
													1943, is just over 50,000. Apart from all that we have done
													to Italy and to German-occupied countries, our reprisals
													mean that on Germany alone, up to the end of October 1943,
													we had already inflicted more than 24 times the suffering
													that we had endured.” The bombing of Hamburg in August 1943
													was described as “probably the most complete blotting–out
													of a city that ever happened” and<em>Reynolds News</em>
													quoted one report: “We passed whole streets, squares and
													even districts that had been razed. Everywhere were charred
													corpses, and injured people had been left unattended. We
													will remember those Hamburg streets as long as we
													live...That night the largest workers’ district of the city
													was wiped out.”
												</p>
												<p>Of course there were bombing raids on such as
													Messerschmitt and industrial production factories by Bomber
													Command. But it was the deliberate whole area “saturation
													bombing” of towns and cities throughout Germany adopted by
													Bomber Command’s chief of staff Arthur Harris that brought
													condemnation, and still does. Vera Brittain’s words from
													1943 still have resonance: “As a Londoner who has been
													through about 600 raid periods and has spent 18 months as a
													volunteer fireguard, I have seen and heard enough to know
													that I at least must vehemently protest when this obscenity
													of terror and mutilation is inflicted upon the helpless
													civilians of another country. Nor do I believe that the
													majority of our airmen who are persuaded that mass bombing
													reduces the period of their peril really want to preserve
													their own lives by sacrificing German women and babies, any
													more than our soldiers would go into action using “enemy”
													mothers and children as a screen.” What she called the
													“horrible facts” about Bomber Command bombing she listed by
													town and city, but these were “not included from
													sensational motives. They are given in order that you who
													read may realise exactly what the citizens of one Christian
													country are doing to the men, women and children of
													another. Only when you know these facts are you in a
													position to say whether or not you approve.”</p>
												<p>Would Vera Brittain—mother of Shirley Williams who in
													later years became a UK government minister—have approved
													the memorial unveiled on Thursday?  Most definitely not.
													She would have had sympathy for the friends and relatives
													of airmen who lost their lives. But the erection of a
													Bomber Command memorial smells of the attempt to bring
													“closure”, with monarchical seal, to a stubborn
													never-quite-going-away sense of shame: closure by erasing
													the perceived relevance, or even awareness, of those
													“horrible facts” that Vera Brittain and others protested
													about at the time. It is a monument to monarchism and
													militarism at a time of economic crisis, a monument for “a
													sense of national unity” in terms for which those old men
													in their wheelchairs are just pawns.</p>
