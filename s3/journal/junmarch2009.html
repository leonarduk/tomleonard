												<p class="MsoNormal">

														after 73 days, the Tamil people who have been permanently
														demonstrating, sometimes in their thousands, in Parliament
														Square outside the House of Commons in London—have finally
														abandoned their protest. One march attracted100.000
														supporters. In their home country 20.000 are reported
														killed in the final Sri Lankan government shelling, and
														quarter of a million Tamils are noweffectively rounded up

												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">Tonight
														the so-called chief reporter for the BBC, John Simpson,
														was wheeled out as he always is when the BBC wants to
														indicate a matter to be of such major moral and political
														importance that we have to get the truth from the top
														man.There he was, breathlessly pouring his hot
														confidential truths into a roving camera. Just as he did
														during the Kosovo war and the bombing of Serbia in the
														nineties. That was when, with claim and counter-claim from
														both sides about fatalities and military progress, Simpson
														reported that Serbs claimed to have shot down a Nato
														plane. This Nato spokemen had denied; and turning to the
														camera, John Simpson solemnly said “Nato never lies.”</span>

															style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">I’ll
																never forget that report. In fact, ever since I usually
																don’t think of him as “John Simpson” at all. I always
																think of him as “Mr Nato-Never-Lies”.</span></span></span>

													now take place in the Tron Theatre bar at 8.15. Admission
													is free.
												</p>
												<p>Things went awry when the initial venue Sloans Bar
													reneged on a deal they have had with the poetry organisers
													Vital Synz for two years, giving them use of a large room.
													And I messed things up describing to friends and others the
													event as a "launch" when it was a long-arranged paid
													reading with admission charge.</p>
												<p>No more. It's now a free reading in the Tron Theatre
													Bar, 8.15 on June 18th. I hope to have the book for anyone
													who wants it afterwards. It's coming out at £9.95.</p>

												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Inthe
														sixties I had an LP of Schoenberg’s <em>Variations
															for Orchestra</em>
													</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
														of 1928, with the CBC Symphony Orchestra under Robert
														Craft, Volume Two of a set that included <em>Pelleas
															and Melisande</em>
													</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
														and <em>Verklaerte Nacht</em>
													</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span>
															<span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12px;"><span
																style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The
																	LP got lost in my various house movements. I’ve bought
																	several performances of the<em>Variations</em>
															</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
																	since, including a new one on Naxos by the now ageing
																	Robert Craft. None seemed as good as the old LP
																	performance in my memory.</span></span>
													</span></span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">But
														a couple of weeks ago the LP turned up on eBay and I
														bought it for £10. My memory was right, it’s a great
														performance, more rhythmic and punchy and exciting than
														any I’ve heard since, while retaining a sense of ongoing
														overall structure andintellectual argument. And a bonus:
														inside the record sleeve are printednotes which include
														Schoenberg’s dialogue with a pupil about the Variations,
														and containing this passage:</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><em>The
															conservatories, with their pervading influence, have long
															furnished—and in assembly line quantities—compositional
															diagrams which they take to be the forms of art; and
															their students, when they arrive at the age of
															production, model their compositions after these diagrams
															(or at least suppose they are doing so, for some of them
															have a guardian angel: talent). The aestheticians are
															happy because they have inspired these products, which
															are thus put on the market, but in reality all this has
															no existence in art, where every content produces its own
															form; and only a robot, a tool of the conservatory as it
															were, could deliberately check the expansion of form
															which every work of art tends to produce. To stop the
															creative processes like this is to systematise ugliness
															itself, and mediocrity, and banality.</em></span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><em><span
															style="font-style: normal;">Change the word
																“conservatories” to “creative writing departments”, and
																Schoenberg’s words still hold. In recent years as
																creative writing departments burgeoned in Britain and
																America, there was a central ideological conflict
																between the concept of providing a creative space where
																it could be allowable that “every content produces its
																own form”; as against a closed space in which
																“traditional genres and forms” were taught as necessary
																basis and precondition of any true artistic identity.<span>
																	Rule-based presuppositions about artistic production
																	made it easier to </span>“mark”, and accorded philosophically
																with containable conservative notions of specific
																canonical poetics. Society-wide, the “Quality Control”
																business model imposed on all public services
																foregrounded "efficiency" as a unit of cost with an
																integral chain of idealogical jargon-clusters such as
																"full economic costing", "visible outcome points",
																"targeted income generation" and so on. The number of
																creative writing classrooms to be washed by cleaners
																could bear relationship to the number of lines of poetry
																to be targeted for production in portfolio by students.
																The full economic costers sought refuge in maintaining
																that any conflict was between those with respect for
																history and rules and those too ignorant to know what
																these were. A creative writing course existed firstly to
																transfer knowledge of history and rules into a student
																who might one day possess sufficient of such to be
																accorded the status of literary artist, going on to
																produce marketable works within a specific artistic
																genre. Making one's resultant niche in the market would
																be what the Quality Control model calls "a good outcome
																indicator".|

												<p>Towards the end of April I mentioned here that I had
													added a link on my links page to Tamilnet. I did so as it
													was the only place I knew to get news from the Tamil side
													about the desperate situation of their people. Now that the
													carnage has come to an end, The Times of London has broken
													the ranks of silence to state that independent medical
													sources in the area told them they had informed the United
													Nations that "at least" twenty thousand civilians had been
													killed. That report was given the UN during the
													bombardment, and some time before it stopped.</p>
												<p>Ban Ki Moon had nothing to say of such matters when
													he made his "official visit". Once again he shows himself
													in my opinion to be the most morally useless, hopelessly
													Nato-and-its-Allies biased UN secretary-general to date. No
													wonder he was the Bush government's approved candidate for
													the job. And another UN spokesman pipes up that the Tamils
													must be held responsible themselves for any Tamil deaths as
													their fighters were "using civilians as human shields". How
													familiar that tape-recorded phrase is becoming from people
													attempting to justify indiscriminate government onslaughts
													on civilian populations.</p>

														style="font-style: italic;">Six Glasgow Poem</span><span
														style="font-style: italic;">s</span> into the pages of a

												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">“<span
														style="font-style: italic;">Managing the language
															environment” reminds me of a trip I made with</span><span
														style="font-style: italic;">my wife and family to
															the then Soviet Union in 1989, a year before the
															Communist system was destined to collapse. We had a
															couple of days in Moscow, three days in what was then
															called Leningrad, and nine days in Yalta in the Ukraine.
															The airport used in the Ukraine was at Simferaporol—the
															place from where, about 84 years earlier, my wife’s
															Jewish forebears, on her mother’s side, had fled the
															pogroms. We didn’t get the chance to explore
															Simferaporol. But what I do mostly remember about that
															holiday, apart from a visit to Chekhov’s house, was my
															attempt in Leningrad to listen to the hotel radio. From
															one end of the radio wave band to the other there was
															only one station to be heard, which I gathered to be
															Radio Moscow. The rest of the band was silent, as creepy
															and eloquent a silence as one could ever hear.</span></span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><span
														style="font-style: italic;">How different in our
															own country. The airwaves awash with “rolling news”, the
															most popular radio stations interrupted every fifteen
															minutes by “news updates”. It is virtually impossible to
															get away from “the news”. Even standing in a bank or post
															office queue, a plasma screen as likely as not is likely
															to be bearing down on one with the rolling 24x7 output of
															Sky News, or BBC 24. And yet—what do I hear?</span></span>

															January, I told the audience it would be a more ethically
															appropriate and efficient way of finding out</span><span
														style="font-style: italic;">what was happening in
															the Middle East if one stuck one’s head in an aluminium
															bucket, than it would be if one listened to the BBC news.
															With one’s head in a bucket one would at least be aware
															that all one could hear was silence—whereas listening to
															“the” news, or reading our valiant Fourth Estate, the
															real silence about what was going on would be one of

														politics of space on the page is a politics of democracy,

														the author-reader experience away from the world of
														passing-the-parcel to those fit to open the parcels of

														literary-academic exegesists this past hundred years);
														towards the structuring of a system of common breath,
