														Myself and several solidarity activists from Lebanon,
														Spain, Canada, Australia, Italy, UK, Ireland and Greece
														managed to get into Gaza aboard the Free Gaza Movement's
														(FGM)&nbsp;<em>Dignity</em>
													</span><span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #191919;">boat.
														FGM has sailed five successful missions to Gaza from
														August to December 2008, bringing in human rights workers
														to build political solidarity activism, to break the
														isolation of ghettoized communities and directly confront
														Israel's illegal and brutal siege.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #191919;">FGM's
														missions are political -- we know Palestine is not a
														charity case, and that the solutions to a 60-year policy
														of ethnic cleansing, apartheid and militarized
														ghettoization are not extra bags of flour, medicine, new
														tents and millions in aid, but political will and direct
														action. This is currently unforthcoming from governments
														around the world, so our actions are about directly
														applying international law from the grassroots up because
														it isn't being respected and is being violated, daily,
														from the top-down -- the siege of Gaza and occupation of
														Palestine is international, the states supporting it
														either with their silence or direct complicity in
														economically supporting Israel are co-occupiers and
														collaborators in war crimes against the Palestinian
														people, along with Israel.</span>

														<span style="font-style: italic;">Previously you
															spent some time in the occupied West Bank during various
															Israeli operations (more particularly in the Jenin
															refugee camp). What were the main differences between the
															two places and what did you expect to see in Gaza? Did
															you expect the attack?</span>
													</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #191919;"><strong>EJ:</strong></span><span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #191919;">
														I didn't expect the attack -- but people in Gaza and the
														Hamas authority did expect an attack because the ceasefire
														had expired and Israel was sabre-rattling, threatening to
														eliminate, as always but with greater intensity and focus,
														resistance leaders -- military and political -- and their
														supporters. There was an increase in unmanned aerial
														vehicles flying 24/7. I had experience of smaller
														operations in the West Bank in Jenin and Nablus following
														Operation Defensive Shield in 2002. Operation Defensive
														Shield was massive, hundreds of Palestinians were killed,
														the heart of Jenin refugee camp was bulldozed and dozens
														of civilians massacred in the process. By the time I came,
														all the ruins and trauma were still very fresh but the
														worst of the destruction and killing had subsided.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #191919;">The
														smaller invasions were carried out under curfew, involving
														hundreds of troops, carrying out house-to-house searches,
														and mass arrests with every man aged between 15 and 50
														rounded up, interrogated and beaten. A typical operation,
														with groups of children throwing anything they can at
														tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs) in the street
														-- and often getting shot at for doing it. There would be
														sporadic resistance at night from fighters, but many of
														the most experienced had been killed at that point. Troops
														would carry out collective punishment like home
														demolitions using bulldozers or explosives and civilians
														would be used as human shields. What was different at that
														time in the West Bank was that a lot of the Palestinian
														Authority's (PA) infrastructure and military
														infrastructure of the resistance -- fighters and leaders
														-- were destroyed during Defensive Shield by F-16 fighter
														jets. Israel was executing its cyclical strategy of having
														decimated the leaders of the armed and political
														resistance of major political factions, moving on to
														target the social infrastructure -- community leaders,
														social activists -- and continuing to arrest relatives of
														the "wanted" and trying to bait out and kill the younger,
														more inexperienced fighters.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="color: #191919; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">Because
														of the tunnels, fighters in Gaza have had access to more
														sophisticated and threatening weaponry than their West
														Bank counterparts, so Israeli aggression has been more
														intense in Gaza and heavily reliant on aerial bombardment.
														Since the withdrawal of the colonists and military bases
														[in 2005], this has increased.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="color: #191919; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">In
														the West Bank, activists could be much more mobile and
														confront and dialogue with soldiers. In Gaza 2009 that was
														impossible. I only once saw soldiers -- a special forces
														soldier trained his gun and apparently shot at our
														ambulance. In the West Bank we were often between tanks
														and APCs and following and observing soldiers close-up. If
														you got close to soldiers in Gaza they'd kill you -- that
														is what everyone kept telling us.</span>

														I planned, as had other activists, to work with
														Palestinian partners -- civil society groups, unions,
														farmers and fishermen, local campaigns for the right to
														education and to end the siege. My role was going to be to
														coordinate and guide visiting delegations coming aboard
														FGM boats along with [Irish human rights activist] Caoimhe
														Butterly. Once the invasion started, it became immediately
														clear that what we needed to do as foreign activists was
														to fulfill our role of witnessing and reporting,
														mitigating the risk to those most likely to be attacked --
														which during invasions are the medical services.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="color: #191919; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">The
														Israeli occupation forces killed 16 rescuers in 22 days
														and injured dozens more. By volunteering with medics we
														attempted to deter attacks on them by informing the media
														and our embassies that we would be accompanying all
														services -- 13 of the medics killed were from the Civil
														Defense services. We did not differentiate between
														"independent" and "government" services; all must be
														protected under international law. Also, we didn't just
														sit in the ambulances, we physically carried the injured
														and dead and tried to assist where possible Secondly, we
														could remain mobile -- ambulances were the only vehicles
														moving around 24 hours; we needed to be able to document
														and report on the attacks as fully as possible. Thirdly,
														in our mobility and proximity to the front line we could
														witness the effects of the bombardment on civilians in
														their homes, and take testimonies from families and
														Palestinian human rights workers inside hospitals.</span>

														The constant sneer of surveillance drones, repetitive
														bombing and crashing sounds, some close some further away,
														muted panic, empty streets, rubble everywhere, ambulance
														sirens wailing endlessly, screaming relatives coupled with
														the groans of the bloodied and dust-covered crushed and
														injured, medics praying and smoking, heart-beating
														perpetual ratcheted-up adrenaline, a constant readiness
														for the next strike and yearning for it to all end,
														endless stream of bodies and blood-soaked stretchers,
														cyclical dread, pierced with fresh-surges of shock and
														horror unabsorbed, and a deep fear of the night and
														whether we would make it through and whether each
														ambulance run might be the last. None of the fear
														paralyzed us but nevertheless it was present. But we all
														early on accepted we could die, and took on the risks
														because it was worth it, the Palestinian people are worth
														it. We wanted to save lives and I know I let go of my
														attachment to mine, inspired and encouraged by the bravery

														Everybody was terrified but defiant. The feeling on the

														The community were glad we were there and kept telling us,

														civilians were deliberately being targeted, that
														hospitals, schools, emergency services were being
														targeted. And that counteracted Israel's propaganda. Also,
														I know for a fact that we lifted the spirits of the medics
														we worked with; they felt they had a witness with them in
														case of their death, and a possible small bit of
														protection against Israeli attack. Everybody needs a
														witness when they're going through hell -- wherever and
														whatever that hell is -- it's a form of solidarity, of
														verification, that the unbelievable really is happening to
														you. Also, we were urging people on the outside to step up
														their protests and direct actions and advocacy for
														boycott, divestment and sanctions. Getting that narrative
														out was important too, peoples' eyes were opened and many

														There were so, so many. Probably the bombing of a house by
														an F-16 just a few feet away from four of our ambulances.
														I was in the passenger seat with my hand on the door, my
														friend and driver told me just wait, wait a little, and
														suddenly there was this enormous explosion -- everything
														went bright fire orange and rubble and debris showered our
														ambulance. One of our drivers was injured and needed to be
														carried out on a stretcher. Our exit route was blocked by
														rubble, a family was screaming and gathering their
														belongings and getting out, we were stumbling with our
														casualty and surveillance drones were thundering above,
														and we feared a repeat strike, more casualties, and losing
														four ambulances when every single one was vital. We
														cheated death that night. The Israelis saw us and our lone
														movement in the streets of Jabaliya, and bombed a house
														less than 10 feet away from us -- this is a criminal,
														reckless use of force.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="color: #191919; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">Another
														was the bombing of the Beit Lahiya Elementary School with
														white phosphorous. We arrived in our ambulances after
														evacuating dozens of residents suffering from phosphoric
														inhalation and after the school had taken a direct hit. I
														was masked up but the stench and smoke was still
														penetrating, and when we got there a second round exploded
														above us, I was frozen to the spot and could see these
														burning blobs raining down next to me, I had to be
														screamed at to move and find shelter. The refugees in the
														school were screaming and crying under a flimsy metal
														shelter in the school yard. The third floor of the school
														was on fire. We brought Bilal Ashkar, aged seven -- just
														this limp boy -- into our ambulance. He'd been hit by the
														phosphorous shell and thrown down the stairs of the school
														by the force of the explosion. He was dead on arrival.</span>

														Palestinians in Gaza should answer that, but what many

														People living in camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the
														West Bank want to be reunited with their families and
														homes. The inalienable and legal right of return for
														Gaza's and all Palestinian refugees needs to be enacted.
														The Israeli tactic of divide and torture, of chopping up
														the Palestinian community, is a long-term tactic designed
														to break down the strongest weapon against ethnic
														cleansing that Palestinians possess -- memory, community,
														family. As long as you have a people who remember their
														homes and lands, and know each other, refer to one another
														as cousin, uncle, sister and brother, and can ask, "Which
														home/family are you from?" then the struggle can never be

														the means to speak and act for themselves and not be

														twinning relationships and projects between schools,

													Watched last night Capra's wonderful 1939&nbsp;<span
														style="font-style: italic;">Mr Smith Goes to
														Washington</span>. Like Lumet's 1957&nbsp;<span
														style="font-style: italic;">Twelve Angry Men </span>it is
													a great statement on behalf of the ideal of democracy in
													America. Capra's film also puts the finger very clearly on
													the manipulation of democracy by corporate media, as
													appropriate today as seventy years ago when the film was
													released.

													Apropos America and democracy in relation to poetry, I have
													now put online the essay I had published in the Edinburgh

												<div>Been freezing weather in Glasgow for some time
													now. A good time to have soup by in the kitchen. I've
													sometimes been asked for my lentil soup recipe. It's plain
													enough&mdash;a big pot of it made this morning. For smaller
													amounts just make proportionate division of quantities.</div>

												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">A
														sizeable pot to comfortably hold 3 and a half to 4 pints
														of water</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wash
														1lb lentils in pot. (swirl them in the pot with three
														different lots of water three times, tipping the excess
														water over the edge of the pot leaving the lentils in a
														wet heap. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chop
														1lb carrots, add.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chop
														half pound turnip, add.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chop
														onion, add. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Now
														pour in the 3 and a half to four pints of water onto the
														pile of stuff in your pot, stirring to keep the lentils
														from sticking to the bottom.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Bring
														to the boil, stirring occasionally to prevent lentils
														sticking. As water turns creamy on top, lower the heat.(Or
														with electric perhaps pull it away from the ring a bit).
														The trick is to bring the soup to the boil in a controlled
														way, not letting it boil over. If it does it doesn&rsquo;t
														matter too much but it&rsquo;s better not to. The carrot
														and turnip kind of foam as the soup approaches boiling,
														which is why there can be a surge of boil-over, like
														heated milk.</span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">When
														you have the soup near boiling, lower the heat. Now is
														when you put the lid on the pot, the object being to get
														the minimum heat which with the upward pressure of steam
														on the lid of the pot, makes the soup slightly more than
														simmer. You have got it right when the pot lid lifts
														gently a bit every few seconds and releases the steam. You
														might have to wait a bit before the first lift. Wait. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">When
														you see the soup first come to boiling, or when you lift
														the pot lid to see how it&rsquo;s getting on, do not
														remove any at all of the scum on the top of the soup, that
														will disappear back into the soup; and again, a short time
														after it has boiled and is now simmering, if you lift the
														lid and look, you might think it needs water, as there is
														no clear fluid. Leave it alone, it will fluidise again as
														it cooks. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">It
														should be ready in about 45 minutes. Then you can decide
														if it needs thinned a bit, and if you want to fluidise it
														as a thick liquid or leave it as it is, a soup with bits
														of vegetables. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span
														style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Add
														salt and pepper to taste. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
													<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">The
														above can of course be done with a ham hough or a smoked
														ham joint in the pot if you are not vegetarian and you
														want added taste. The ham can then be had separately
														and/or cut into wee bits to add to plates of soup.</span>
