												</p>
												<p>
													In a local secondhand bookshop years ago I came on&nbsp;<em>Rhymes
														of the Road and Ballads of Ben Venue: Notions from
														Navvy-Land </em>by H G Gallacher, a pocketsized booklet of
													seventy pages published in Oban in 1930. In the foreword
													Hugh Gallacher says:&nbsp;<em>In presenting to a
														sometimes critical public this little compilation of
														verses, in the composition of which many a dreary hour was
														whiled away in solitary hostels by the author, who, to use
														the expressive phraseology of his workmates, often had
														&ldquo;to keep life in by knocking it out,&rdquo; we
														desire to make it plain that the writer labours under no
														delusions in regard to his abilities in the matter.</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													<em>It was while in the employment of Messrs P
														MacBride &amp; Co Ltd, Contractors, Port Glasgow, that
														most of the pieces reproduced herewith were written in the
														romance-haunted vicinity of the world-renowned Trossachs,
														a place which during our first week or so there, we knew
														as much about as a kangaroo knows of the internal
														construction of a Zeppelin.</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													Gallacher thanks the&nbsp;<em>Callander Advertiser</em> for
													its overall support, much of the contents evidently having
													appeared there. Said contents are mostly light sentimental
													stuff you might expect in a local newspaper, but the
													opening poem as reproduced here is different, reminiscent
													more of preceding work by Gallacher&rsquo;s fellow navvy
													writer&mdash;also from Donegal&mdash;Patrick Magill.

												</p>
												<p>
													<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
												</p>
												<p>
													News of the death of the Parliamentary Square peace
													protestor Brian Haw yesterday coincided with the latest
													anti-Gaddafi Horror Story.This time the&nbsp;<em>Observer</em>stated
													that papers newly found in Misrata by Gaddafi&rsquo;s
													opponents showed in &ldquo;chilling detail&rdquo; how he
													had intended to besiege it. One paper apparently stated "It
													is absolutely forbidden for supply cars, fuel and other
													services to enter the city of Misrata from all gates and
													checkpoints." Proof indeed for &ldquo;crimes against
													humanity&rdquo; charges if he survived to be brought to
													trial!
												</p>
												<p>When Haw set up his peace camp in 1991, it was in
													protest against the economic sanctions imposed by the UK
													and American governments against Iraq. This is a list of
													some of the common everyday items &ldquo;absolutely
													forbidden&rdquo; to be allowed into the whole country. The
													selection was made in 1997.</p>
												<p>
													<img
														src="http://tomleonard.co.uk/images/iraq sanctions 790.jpg"
														alt="iraqsanctions" width="790" height="557" border="0" />
												</p>
												<p>But this was just some of the everyday items. Two
													years earlier in December 1995 the United Nations Food and
													Agriculture Organisation reported &ldquo;More than one
													million Iraqis have died &mdash;567,000 of them
													children&mdash;as a direct consequence of economic
													sanctions. ... As many as 12% of the children surveyed in
													Baghdad are wasted, 28% stunted and 29% underweight.&rdquo;
													The following year in October 1996&nbsp; UNICEF reported
													&ldquo;4,500 children under the age of 5 are dying each
													month from hunger and disease... The situation is
													disastrous for children. Many are living on the very margin
													of survival.&rdquo;&nbsp; In April 1998 UNICEF reported
													again &ldquo;Approximately 250 people die every day in Iraq
													due to the effect of the sanctions.&rdquo;</p>
												<p>There has never been discussion of charging anyone in
													Britain or America responsible with &ldquo;crimes against
													humanity&rdquo; for the effects of these sanctions.
													&nbsp;Instead, show trials of defeated leaders provide
													excuse for ostentatious moral outrage in despite of the
													accusers&rsquo; own much greater guilt. The complicity of
													corporate journalists here continues to be integral, and
													the stand of Brian Haw for years in Parliament Square was a
													reminder.</p>

													<strong>Nato bombing Tripoli Tuesday June 7th 2011</strong>
												</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>
													The bombing of Libya began, it was claimed, to prevent
													&ldquo;massacres&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>planned</em> to happen.
													Then there were reports of Libyan government aerial bombing
													on residential neighbourhoods&nbsp;<em>actually</em>
													happening. Then Russia pointed out their satellites showed
													not a single plane in the skies when this aerial bombing
													was supposed to have been taking place. Then there were
													supposed to be Libyan government helicopters bombing whilst
													maliciously daubed with the Red Cross. Then it was
													&ldquo;cluster bombs&rdquo; claimed by Channel Four News in
													one of its now commonplace &ldquo;privileged scoop&rdquo;
													affairs. That too was later buried, the Libyans never
													having had cluster bombs in the first place. Then, wondrous
													to relate, it was viagra handed out to Libyan government
													soldiers with intent to rape&mdash;presumably to accompany
													zimmers already distributed to soldiers who needed viagra
													in the first place. Amidst all this nonsense, it slipped
													out that six hundred Libyans fleeing Nato bombing had died
													in a foundered ship. Gasp. Nato brutality? An admission of
													something amiss? Nay!!! Two days later came the reassuring
													news that it was all down to Gaddafi &ldquo;deliberately
													forcing people into unseaworthy vessels at gunpoint.&rdquo;
												</p>
												<p>Wearisome. Every day, every hour, every newsbulletin,
													every newspaper, for four months. And Al Jazeera become
													Nato&rsquo;s spokesperson in the Arab world: its owner
													Qatar bankrolls Libyan opposition, acts as broker for
													commandeered though previously nationalised Libyan oil and
													financial assets; sets up &ldquo;Libya TV&rdquo;
													broadcasting propaganda from Qatar while Nato bombs the
													real one in Libya. Iranian Press TV, again, though no
													friend of Nato, from the outset sided with Islamic
													opposition in eastern Libya opposed to the secular
													government in Tripoli.</p>
												<p>Then along comes Nato&rsquo;s joker, Luis Moreno
													Ocampo, prosecutor of the so-called International Criminal
													Court, not to be confused with the international court in
													the Hague. This one acquired office nine years ago
													essentially to prosecute African leaders pursued by the
													West; at any rate, none but African leaders have been so
													pursued or charged. Yet nine years on and Moreno Campo has
													not made a single charge stick on anyone. His attempts in
													Sudan, as the BBC&rsquo;s own legal man Joshua Rozenberg
													wrote in October 2010, caused judges to be&nbsp; "shocked
													by their falsity, both in fact and law". Again: &ldquo;the
													prosecutor failed to comply with repeated orders to give
													defence lawyers the name of an intermediary who had
													assisted the prosecution by liaising with witnesses. Some
													intermediaries are alleged to have helped witnesses
													fabricate statements.&rdquo; In that article&nbsp;
													Rozenberg wrote that a spell in the dock might teach Oreno
													Campo himself some basic principles of justice.</p>
												<p>Forget that, move on six months, to March 2011. Up
													pops this prosecutor of African leaders once more, just
													after Nato has started bombing Libya. It&rsquo;s
													&ldquo;crimes against humanity&rdquo; time,&nbsp; now for
													those &ldquo;massacres&rdquo; supposedly at the planning
													stage. These die the death, so to speak, but charges could
													still help Nato invade &ldquo;to pursue arrest&rdquo; if
													occasion demands. So up bounces Oreno Campo once again this
													month, this time with the already derided
													&ldquo;evidence&rdquo; of&nbsp; devilish soldiers with a
													rifle in one hand and a bottle of viagra in the other. I
													think it is supposed to be planned genocide by aphrodisiac.
													But nothing is too nonsensical for TV or corporate press to
													tell with a straight face. Feed the pigs. Into the trough
													with it! There&rsquo;s a war on!</p>
												<p>There must always be a war on. What would we do with
													our armaments otherwise? Don&rsquo;t have an enemy? Of
													course we do. Terrorists. Terrorists are those foreigners
													fighting the troops who bombed and invaded their foreign
													countries merely to stop terrorism in the first place.
													Simple, really. An eternal loop.&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Don&rsquo;t get habituated.&nbsp; Even if singly,
													there&rsquo;s millions of us, billions even. We are the
													ones not in power. If the bastards get you in the end, they
													still haven&rsquo;t got your mind.&nbsp;</p>

												<p>The painter Alex Aitchison has died. I got the news
													yesterday in an email from a friend, to whom I replied

												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That's bad to hear about
													Alex. I remember asking him about his life sitting drinking
													together in Tennent's umpteen years ago. Quarriers, and I
													think his experiences there marked him. Some people don't
													get good cards played them, but Alex had a lot of folk who
													felt warm about him including me. He kept facing forward he
													would not fucking lie down, there was that in him in his
													own shuffling way. He was in the day you were in whenever
													you met him, a hell of a lot of people are not like that.
													They're somewhere else. Maybe he was condemned forever to
													be in the day he was in, but he didn't complain and always
													had something for the future on the go, from what i could
													gather. I'm sorry to realise I won't see him again.&nbsp;</p>

													My memoir of R D Laing reminds me I have another memoir on
													my hard disk. Years ago I took part in a BBC Radio Four
													programme in a series called&nbsp;<em>Off the Page</em>.
													Each programme in the series had three invited writers who
													would read a piece for about five minutes on the
													week&rsquo;s chosen theme. After each contribution there
													would be a studio discussion amongst the three writers and
													a chairperson.
												</p>
												<p>The theme of the programme to which I was invited to
													contribute was &ldquo;My father&rdquo;. The other two
													writers were the poet Simon Armitage and a biographer whose
													name I can&rsquo;t remember. This was the short piece I
													read on the air.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 360px;">
													<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">My
															Father</span></strong>
												</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>To say anything about my father on a radio
														programme being broadcast throughout Britain seems an odd
														thing. In my memory I value most his silences, his quality
														of silence. He never once expressed an opinion on the
														things that I usually hear expressed as opinions on Radio
														Four or Radio Five. The idea of his being on a programme
														like this would have been a contradiction in terms. What
														were those terms.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>That being is not the same as talking about it, or
														naming it. That the value of something is not determined
														by the quality of intelligent sounding opinion about it.</em>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>What do I value most in his memory. Climbing up
														and sitting on his shoulders when he came in from work,
														feeling the silver stubble on his face with the palms of
														my hands. What&rsquo;s my saddest memory of him. Seeing
														him sitting alone in his chair when I came down the stairs
														the morning after my mother had died. There was an
														eternity of space round about him, as if his chair was
														surrounded by an eternal space.</em>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>He was an immigrant from Dublin to Glasgow when he
														was 14 and worked as a railwayman, as he always said to
														the fraction, 48 and a half years until his retiral. I
														remember that when he was going out to work, which could
														be at any time of his shift, he would be in clean
														dungarees and the black railway hat. I remember the smell
														of the hat, and the shape of the thin leather crown. My
														mother would have his sandwiches, or pieces as we call
														them, wrapped in the paper wrapping of a loaf, and there
														would be cold tea in&nbsp; a half pint dark bottle for him
														to heat up on the hotplate of his railway engine.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>Before he went to work, my father would always go
														into the kitchen when there was nobody else there, and
														kneel on the kitchen floor resting his elbows on a chair
														and pray for a minute or two. He liked to be alone for
														that, though he never complained if you came in while he
														was doing it.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>When he eventually retired from the railway, he
														was given a railway pension of ten shillings a week. His
														state pension was not enough for him to pay the rent and
														live on, so he had a rent supplement added to this state
														pension by the government. The ten shillings was then
														deducted from that rent supplement, so after 48 and a half
														years he received nothing at all from his job in the
														railway, apart from a watch given him by his union.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>I only once read a few poems to my father, as I
														wanted him to understand what mattered to me.
														"That&rsquo;s fine Tom" was about all he said after I read
														them, though I didn&rsquo;t feel angry or hurt. I could
														see that he listened, and he had not tried to be nasty or
														snooty, which was not in his nature anyway.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>In fact I probably owe my love of poetry
														indirectly to my father, though it was years after the
														event that I realised this. I&nbsp; was about sixteen when
														a friend sat an external exam for entrance to somewhere or
														other, and showed me the exam paper. On it was Stephen
														Spender&rsquo;s poem, "The Express", which began:</em>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 120px;">
													<img src="http://tomleonard.co.uk/images/spender.jpg"
														alt="spender" width="273" height="55"
														style="border: 0px initial initial;" border="0" />
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>and so on, about a steam engine leaving a station.
														I was hooked on the music of it, and from that defining
														moment in my life, it was to be poetry that I wanted to
														write. That it was about a steam engine the same as my
														father drove every day did not strike me at the time.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>During my teens there was a while I looked down on
														my father, and&nbsp; wrote a letter to my best friend in
														which I poured out sarcasm in different ways. I never
														posted it, and my father discovered the letter. He was
														angry, and I could see that I had hurt him. I had been the
														first to stay on at school, the first to be helped to
														university, and so on. The usual. A long while later,
														visiting home after I was married, I told him once in
														conversation, "I&rsquo;m really sorry that I wrote that
														letter." He was pleased, though as usual didn&rsquo;t make
														a fuss of it.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>After he died, I wrote a poem about my
														relationship with him, with my own young sons, and with my
														relationship with poetry audiences, having become a poet
														known among other things for writing poems in Glasgow
														dialect. It was a way of expressing my sense of regret
														about the way some things have to happen for growth, of
														identifying with my father in his being outside the
														official language in his own way, and finally the sense
														that the unknowable judgement of my own young sons lay
														ahead for me in the future after my own death. I called
														the poem "Fathers and Sons".</em>

													Someone emailed me asking my views about R D Laing in the
													light of the talk I gave at the Mitchell about 18 months
													ago on Laing and Beckett. I never wrote that up&mdash;I may
													yet some day&mdash;but I sent him from my hard disk this
													transcript of my responses to Bob Mullan included in his
													collection of interviews, memoirs and essays about Laing
													published as&nbsp;<em>R D Laing: Creative Destroyer</em> in
													1997.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>The first time I met Laing would be about 1969 at
														his place in Wimpole Street. I was going down to London
														for a reading and Tom McGrath suggested that I go and see
														him. I didn&rsquo;t fancy doing that as I didn&rsquo;t
														know him, and I really don&rsquo;t like this visiting the
														shrine stuff... But Tom, who had been publishing my work
														in Glasgow, knew Laing personally and thought he might be
														interested in meeting me as well.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>Anyway I phoned and remember the odd feeling of
														getting an answering machine. From R.D. Laing! (laughs)
														But we made an arrangement and I remember going up to this
														really wee room away up some stairs. He was very pleasant
														and open, talking about what was going on in his life at
														the time. Saying also that he was pestered at that time
														particularly with people&mdash;I think he said from
														America&mdash;more or less hoping to get their souls
														salved by return of post.</em>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>I didn&rsquo;t see him again for ages, the next
														time I met him would be sometime in the early eighties,
														when I was doing a reading/performance in Camden at what
														was called a Sound Poetry Festival. There were people
														doing things mainly using tape recorders, and I at that
														time had hoped to perform work using stereo tape recorders
														and placards, tapes that included settings of work by
														Kierkegaard among other things... Anyway (laughs)
														&nbsp;the equipment they had available, which was about
														the size of the flight deck of the Concorde, was half
														track, and my tapes were quarter track, so I was kind of
														stuck in this place, and just gave a straight reading, of
														my dialect poems and other things.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>Ronnie Laing came up at the end and introduced
														himself. He&rsquo;d forgotten we&rsquo;d met for that
														short time before, but we went for a drink. We got on
														well, I don&rsquo;t really remember what we talked about
														to be honest, we just talked. I had things to say to him,
														it was quite important in my life, his work. So it was
														good from that point of view to be meeting him again, and
														I was glad he had now met&nbsp; my own work as it were. We
														had a drink then</em>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>I had to go for the late train back to Scotland.
														After that he contacted me a number of times when he was
														in Glasgow, usually when he was&nbsp; with John Duffy who
														lives quite near my own home. We would go out for a drink
														then back to John&rsquo;s or my place.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>I was making notes this morning as to what his
														work meant to me. I haven&rsquo;t read The Divided Self
														for almost twenty years. It&rsquo;s a book I never had in
														the house because I kept giving it away. I must have
														bought it three times and given it away three times. I
														still have The Politics of Experience , Knots, and the
														autobiography, Wisdom, Madness and Folly,&nbsp;
														&nbsp;which he sent to&nbsp; me when it was published. I
														can get a bit uptight when someone asks me directly
														&ldquo;What do you think of my book?&rdquo; and Ronnie
														asked me that the next time we met in Glasgow. I
														remember&mdash;I suppose it can sound a bit sentimental or
														a silly thing to say&mdash; but I&nbsp; I said the best
														thing in the book was the expression in the eyes of the
														wee boy on the cover. It was an early photograph of him. I
														don&rsquo;t think he knew how to take that. I think he had
														hoped for a more critical response. (laughs)</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>I&rsquo;d like to say about Laing&rsquo;s work, it
														had a liberating effect on&nbsp; me, which directly
														affected&nbsp; my own writing.&nbsp; The Divided Self
														&nbsp;when I read it first about 1965 or so seemed to me
														part of a spectrum that included&nbsp; books such as&nbsp;
														Kierkegaard&rsquo;s Either-Or,&nbsp; Beckett&rsquo;s
														novels, Sartre&rsquo;s Nausea, Robbe-Grillet, Gabriel
														Marcel&rsquo;s Being and Having.&nbsp; What Laing got to
														the heart of was the nature of complicity in relationships
														within institutional structures,&nbsp; and the creation of
														supposedly self-invalidating &ldquo;otherness&rdquo; in
														people who do not&nbsp; &ldquo;speak the right
														language&rdquo;. His ideas have as much bearing on
														literature and the reading process&nbsp; as on psychiatry.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>What Laing had to say about the status and nature
														of &ldquo;scizophrenic&rdquo; language as perceived by
														doctors and the relatives of a patient, had bearing for me
														on the perception of nonstandard English and dialect
														language&nbsp; in Literature.&nbsp; The dialect speaker
														tends to appear in a narrative like Laing&rsquo;s patient
														in a hospital: there is complicity between author and
														reader that that speaker is &ldquo;other&rdquo;, that the
														user of such language cannot be the person who has written
														or who is reading the work. It comes down to
														language,&nbsp; often&nbsp; the nature of the Present
														Tense. Laing demonstrated how language is used to
														invalidate the access of others to an agreed universal
														present supposedly shared exclusively by people in related
														positions of power. In other words, to deny people their
														full existence.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>It&rsquo;s not that I agreed with everything he
														had to say, or liked all his writing. The second time we
														met I said to him &ldquo;Your mother had a childhood as
														well you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think it depends where you
														establish the boundary of the family structure when you
														criticise it, because if you establish it at her
														adulthood, then the mother enters the structure as an
														institution, and not as a person. That&rsquo;s what I
														would say, the structure has to be large enough to include
														her childhood as well. If the mother is repressed and
														directing attentions at the child in a way that is loading
														that child with an awareness of consciousness that is, you
														know, nothing a child should be asked to
														bear....Nonetheless, she might have been abused as a wean,
														to be such a repressed figure, if that is the way to
														define her. I don&rsquo;t know, I never met Ronnie
														Laing&rsquo;s own mother. But in the autobiography she
														does not come across to me as a three-dimensional person.
														Ach, so what, at this stage? I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t
														exhume Ronnie just to berate him as somebody who wisnae
														good to his mammy... (laughs)</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>Again, although his analysis of language and
														institutional power was so important,&nbsp; I had
														reservations about the idea that scizophrenic language, or
														the language of hallucination,&nbsp; the language of
														non-shared experience, was necessarily a healthy fuse
														against a dsyfunctional structure.&nbsp;
														Specifically,&nbsp; the approved metaphor of
														&ldquo;journey&rdquo; of breakdown in The Politics of
														Experience &nbsp;I had trouble with.&nbsp; It seemed to me
														that a vulnerable reader with incipient psychotic symptoms
														might feel they should just hold on as they were at the
														beginning of a journey of liberation. This could have very
														bad consequences if they thought the pilot was God, or the
														voice in their&nbsp; head. Ronnie when I raised this with
														him said that that was a misunderstanding of his position,
														that the provision of understanding help in a safe place
														should be part of the healing process (as indicated in the
														conclusions to Chapter Seven).</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>I mention these things not to join with the
														negative criticism that has been unleashed since he died,
														some of it the settling of old scores I&rsquo;m sure. That
														there should even be talk of The Divided Self&nbsp;
														going&nbsp; out of print is extraordinary.&nbsp; I think
														the discrediting of Ronnie Laing since he died is part of
														a whole discrediting of, I don&rsquo;t like the phrase
														&ldquo;the person-centred&rdquo; but there you are.
														It&rsquo;s part of the way the Tories have been
														discrediting so much&nbsp; from the sixties as that was
														the last decade they weren&rsquo;t in power. So it&rsquo;s
														all the guff about &ldquo;getting teaching back to those
														who know what value is, pouring value into those who
														don&rsquo;t, and none of this bloody nonsense that
														we&rsquo;ve all got value individually&rdquo; - you know
														what I mean.&nbsp; The attack on Laing is part of the same
														thing, only it&rsquo;s wrapped up in smokescreen
														anecdotage&nbsp; about Laing being drunk, presenting him
														as a boozer and a druggie, and therefore a poser.</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>His stand for the authentic in&nbsp; human
														relationships will be remembered long after the carpers
														have been forgotten. Thinking of him historically,
														he&rsquo;s obviously part of a European existential
														tradition. But in relation to Scotland, I&rsquo;ve been
														thinking about him recently&nbsp; in relation to James
														Thomson the Port Glasgow author of &ldquo;The City of
														Dreadful Night&rdquo;, and the West of Scotland in the
														nineteenth century. You can think of Laing in relation to
														Robert Owen&rsquo;s New Lanark, to James Thomson&rsquo;s
														&ldquo;The City of Dreadful Night&rdquo;,&nbsp; to
														Alasdair Gray&rsquo;s Lanark,&nbsp; to Ian Hamilton
														Finlay&rsquo;s garden at Stonypath. Places of authentic
														communal being, or allegories of inauthentic structure.
														Thomson wrote &ldquo;The City of Dreadful Night&rdquo; in
														1874. His mother in Port Glasgow&nbsp; was a follower of
														the millenialist preacher Edward Irving in the
														1830&rsquo;s. I did a lot of research on that for my
														biography of Thomson.&nbsp; With the inruption of the
														industrial revolution, and the alienation of
														relationships, models such as the millenarian New
														Jerusalem were longed for as a place where those who had
														been self-objectified as other could come into their own
														at last...</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>But reading about that millenarian fever of the
														1830&rsquo;s, what actually triggered it in the West of
														Scotland was the preaching by a local minister of the
														Universal Atonement as&nbsp; against the Calvinist
														doctrine of the Elect. You can see this in political terms
														of the time as the House of Commons versus the House of
														Lords (laughs)....</em>&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<em>But looking at the Universal Atonement that was
														being preached in the 1830&rsquo;s, what it meant, it was
														the validation of the specificness of people&rsquo;s
														ontology: in that, being in the Present, Christ was
														presently available to them.&nbsp; And therefore, in
														Christian terms&mdash;you know, in Christian terms,
														I&rsquo;m not a Christian&mdash;they were capable of
														redemption. In other words, in that&nbsp; sense, they were
														universally valid, in their specificness&mdash;as distinct
														from the preordained, or I would call behaviourist, notion
														of the Elect. So I see Laing within that tradition as
														well. In a sense it&rsquo;s a kind of universal atonement
														he&rsquo;s talking about.</em>&nbsp;

													<strong>Theodore Ritch</strong> was born in Odessa in 1894.
													Leaving Russia in 1917 he had a successful career in Europe
													and America as an opera tenor. He retired to teach singing
													in Paris, but was arrested there in 1943 and sent by train
													from the concentration camp at Drancy to one of the
													principal camps in Poland. He died in the vehicle en route.

													<strong>Josef Schmidt</strong> was born in 1904 in a part
													of Romania and his voice first attracted attention as
													cantor in his local synagogue. Sent to study music in
													Berlin he became internationally famous making many
													records, with sundry Europe-America tours, and singing as
													lead in a number of films. Still he could not live in Nazi
													Germany, and was further forced in 1940 to flee occupied
													France for&nbsp; Brussels. But projected escape to America
													was thwarted as that route had been closed to passengers
													before he could take advantage of it. He managed to get to
													Switzerland but despite his fame and that American tours
													had made him possessor of an American visa, he was interned
													in harsh conditions in a refugee camp. Complaints of chest
													pains went unattended. He died of a heart attack in
													November 1942 aged 38.

													<strong>May 2nd</strong>
												</p>
												<p>The recording on Friday was a success. Which is to
													say, I gave it some kind of laldy in the room for two
													sessions over something like 80 minutes. And the response
													was favourable, people seemed well pleased and talking to
													me afterwards and so on.</p>
												<p>But. I hate the fact of being recorded in the
													presence of people when reading my poems. In terms of
													&ldquo;response&rdquo; that has been much deeper in
													readings I have done over this past couple of years than it
													was on Friday. Not that I have given a damn about the
													&ldquo;response&rdquo;. It is and always has been just
													being in the presence of people in a kind of dialogue,
													inhabiting the words I know, &ldquo;playing my tunes&rdquo;
													as I think of of my Glasgow poems, and finding out the
													kinetics of the thought of various poems supposedly about
													&ldquo;politics&rdquo;, setting out to the end of them the
													way I write essays, which is to say setting out to find out
													how I get to the end.</p>
												<p>
													Friday was different. It was part of a MayDay series of
													events that was going on in the STUC advertised through the
													same union bodies who had been at an event 18 months ago
													where I gave a rowdy ten minute contribution in among
													singers and comedians. Fine, and no inauthenticity there;
													but a long way from me talking about haeccitas and my
													kinetic formal poems at the CCA ten days ago. That
													wasn&rsquo;t stuffy, at the end of it I was able to
													read&nbsp;<em>nora&rsquo;s place </em>in a way I had never
													read before and will never read again: the whole concept of
													&ldquo;thisness&rdquo; in relation to a person had, to
													myself, been contextualised: so nora was revealed to me,
													more than to anyone, as something I fell into reading in a
													way that I was discovering it as I read it.
												</p>
												<p>And that can only even possibly happen when nothing
													is being recorded. Where there is no possibility of being
													self-objectified, and the transitoriness is what counts.
													Being versus having, as I have said all me life now. Of
													course I&rsquo;m a trooper enough to have put on a good
													show on Friday. But it wasn&rsquo;t me. It was brave after
													a fashion, I tell myself. But for the first time in my life
													I think, I had to be &ldquo;a performer&rdquo;. And I rose
													to it, I performed well. Even, in poems like &ldquo;A Fair
													Cop&rdquo; I did get into it, released it as it came. And
													the poem to Sonya and some others, could be
													declaimed-in-the-presence of, so to speak.</p>
												<p>
													But a real reading for me is one where I do what I can do
													then, as I walk from the stage, the whole flushes out of my
													mind and I forget about it all together. Each reading for
													me is a new one, and I never know what i will read.
													Sometimes, as in St Ives some months back, I will step into
													my poems as the only safe space for miles around, at least
													to be in the presence of the words. A poem I wrote that was
													in&nbsp;<em>access to the silence </em>has it:
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 180px;">
													<img src="http://tomleonard.co.uk/images/respite.jpg"
														alt="respite" width="213" height="280"
														style="border: 0px initial initial;" border="0" /><span
														style="line-height: 1.3em;"></span>
												</p>
												<p>The respite, that &ldquo;present&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t
													available to me on Friday, it just couldn&rsquo;t be on an
													occasion where folk were there &ldquo;to be present at a
													recording&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t a place where my inmost
													feelings could venture into the words, safe in their
													transitoriness in form. So there was no place for nora,
													certainly, though I read her &ldquo;well enough&rdquo;.</p>
												<p>I&rsquo;ll edit down the CD to whatever comes over
													best, maybe subsititute another nora or whatever from what
													I have already recorded. What I say here by the way I know
													will be absolutely unfathomable to some people who were
													there on Friday and who I know really enjoyed what
													happened. I gave a good performance overall. It was "a good
													night out". But my work isn&rsquo;t about
													&ldquo;peformance&rdquo;, though it might seem
													performatory. in fact that is precisely why I usually
													forbid actors reading it on radio or TV. What I did enjoy
													reading (and naturally a performance) was my version of
													some of Brecht&rsquo;s Mother Courage songs. In the absence
													yet of permission from Germany for Smokestack to publish my
													translation of the play&mdash;only one British publisher
													has been given permission to publish the play in the past
													half century&mdash;it was a chance to let some of my
													translation at least be heard.</p>

													Still some tickets left for my reading tomorrow Friday 29<sup>th</sup>
													at the STUC centre, the old converted school at the top of
													Woodlands Road. Some may know the building for the Stand
													comedy venue, though the event won&rsquo;t be in that room
													but the main central atrium. You can get in at the door
													though a lot of the tickets are away so if you want to buy
													in advance you can get them online&nbsp;<a

												</p>
												<p>The evening is organised by Fair Pley Ltd who are
													recording it to issue it as a CD later this year.
													There&rsquo;s a few things going on in the centre over the
													weekend to do with MayDay and as an alternative to the
													unmentionable event in London. I don&rsquo;t usually plan
													in advance my readings, it&rsquo;s not the way I work, but
													I&rsquo;m pretty certain I will give my Mother Courage
													songs an airing as well as a fair selection of my work from
													the sixties to date.</p>
												<p>There will be a little show of some of my posters,
													some of which I think can be bought or at least ordered. I
													will also project some visual work here and there to vary
													it or even give my voice a little rest. I&rsquo;ll do two
													sets with an interval.</p>
												<p>There will be a bar, and Fair Pley have arranged a
													curry buffet before the show so that people don't have to
													miss their teatime grub. &nbsp;Doors open 6.15 pm, my
													reading kicks off at seven.</p>

												<p>Nearly a fortnight since we came back from a
													week&rsquo;s holiday in Fuerteventura.&nbsp; A week that
													proved wonderfully restorative for dodgy Glasgow lungs like
													mine; and being without British &ldquo;news&rdquo; for a
													week was like a Victorian colonic for the mind. Before we
													left for holiday, my attempts to avoid the mediawide
													orchestrated anti-Gaddafi hate-garbage had been breached by
													a headline the morning after 140 Cruise missiles had begun
													28-country Nato's onslaught on the same Libyan government
													forces previously described as &ldquo;kept deliberately
													small in number lest they should overthrow their
													leader.&rdquo; The headline which caught my eye as I queued
													in my local Saintsbury's read &ldquo;Top Guns 1 Mad Dog
													0&rdquo;. British racism and colonialism as alive and well
													as ever in its hack &ldquo;journalists&rdquo;.</p>
												<p>A deal of the Left backed the Libyan protestors at
													first as a popular rising, but came to realise that whoever
													the mass of the people demonstrating initially were, their
													leaders are now a &ldquo;council&rdquo; of American-Nato
													implants. Men like military leader Khalifa Hifter,
													understood to have become a CIA agent after twenty years in
													Washington; or their so-called &ldquo;finance
													minister&rdquo; Ali Tarhouni just back from 26 years as
													senior business lecturer in Washington University, where
													his wife is in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.
													Tarhouni arranged the seizure of the Libyan nationalised
													bank and oil assets which Qatar agreed to market. Just like
													that. Qatar had patched up its difference with Egypt, so
													their Al Jazeera station could get back into Nato line,
													forgetting Egypt protest and making its anchor reporter in
													Libya the ex Fox News Anita MacNaught, there with all the
													other Western hacks in Benghazi practically doubling that
													city&rsquo;s population to broadcast endless one-sided
													rumour and "reporting".</p>
												<p>Mass shooting of demonstrators in Bahrain, forget it.
													The home of the Fifth Fleet is the home of the Fifth Fleet.
													The &ldquo;Arab Dawn&rdquo; well and truly flushed down the
													lav. Egypt under pro-Nato Tawani has banned strikes and the
													very demonstrations that were two months ago hailed as
													symptoms of the people&rsquo;s desire for freedom.
													&nbsp;Bluster about &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; and the
													usual &ldquo;fearless&rdquo; so called war-reporting
													against &ldquo;tryanny&rdquo; is now focussed exclusively -
													and endlessly - &nbsp;on Libya, Syria and Iran. Which is to
													say, the three countries in the Meditteranean not on side
													with the Nato alliance.&nbsp;And that is how &ldquo;the
													Arab Dawn&rdquo; has been dealt with, and is being dealt
													with. The "desire for freedom" is now a three-country
													affair. Read all about it. You might as well. You have no
													choice.</p>
												<p>
													Unless the token scattering of leftwing commentators like
													Seamus Milne, or if you can be bothered, through some
													dogged work on the net. I recommend &nbsp;the Asia Times
													correspondent Pepe Escobar whose articles on the Middle
													East since January can be seen&nbsp;<a

												<p>Some time ago Leslie Crook wrote a poetry sequence
													&ldquo;The Book of the Dead&rdquo; about life in a

													<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Demonstration
															by Disabled Rights Group Black Triangle at Atos Scottish
															headquarters in Livingstone, January 24th.</strong></span>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 180px;">
													<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>A
															similar demonstration was held at the Atos offices in
															Cadogan Street Glasgow on February 23rd.</strong></span>
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 120px;">
													<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></span>
												</p>
												<p>A friend who accompanied someone with mental health
													issues to an Atos disability reassessment interview found
													the interviewer to be sitting behind a computer screen out
													of eye contact. Answers to the standard questionaire were
													clicked into the computer. My friend attested to the
													interviewer (who had a heavy German accent which made the
													situation slightly more surreal) as to the reliability of
													the patient&rsquo;s answers and his day to day fluctuation
													in continuing severity of illness. Notice was posted to the
													claimant subsequently that his benefit had been terminated.
													He went through the process of appeal. Fully nine months
													later he was called to the appeal interview. This was heard
													before what seemed to be a retired psychiatrist and a
													retired social worker. On conclusion he was asked to wait
													outside the room then was called in after ten minutes to be
													told that his appeal had been upheld.</p>
												<p>The questions in the initial interview are not
													accidentally loaded in their narrowness and their inability
													to take qualificatory answers. They are so loaded because
													they were designed using purely financial, not medical,
													targets set by the previous government&mdash; the Labour
													government under Work and Pensions minister James Purnell
													and his successors such as the recently ermined
													&ldquo;Lord&rdquo; Hutton, helped across the floor of the
													House after the elections to provide the Conservatives with
													his template for cutting public pensions. The target is to
													cut benefit spending by billions of pounds, indeed, as
													Purnell and his chums established, to remove the words
													&ldquo;benefit&rdquo; and &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; from
													the equation altogether. An unknown number of claimants
													have disappeared from records. Some are known to have
													commited suicide, like the Edinburgh poet Paul Reekie near
													to whose body last June were found letters including the
													disallowance of his housing and incapacity benefit. The
													press as always are loyal to measures stigmatising the poor
													and unemployed: &nbsp;&ldquo;94% of benefit claimants shown
													to be cheats&rdquo; was a headline in the Daily Mail, where
													else, in January this year. Since 40% of those who go to
													disability appeal have it eventually upheld this is taken
													as evidence by Labourites and Liberals small and large
													&ldquo;L&rdquo;, that the system is decent at heart and can
													catch the really needy. Nonsense. It simply shows that the
													financial targets have been set to disallow 60% of that
													percentage of the disallowed who have been capable and
													willing to survive the long wait for an appeal to be heard.</p>
												<p>
													So, no help to the sick and unemployed from the
													Parliamentary parties, who have united in attacking them.
													Not that they would admit it in plain words. They prefer
													sweetsounding mealy ones. However some non-party local
													groups have been making protest and trying to help one
													another.&nbsp;<a

															against Poverty</span></a> have been involved and their site has
													useful information and links to others for those caught up
													in having to claim help or to work out what to do when
													summoned to interview. Another small organisation of
													Glasgow anti-benefit cuts people are on the web&nbsp;<a

												</p>
												<p>
													Many of these including the Scottish groups will be taking
													part in the third National Day of Protest Against the Cuts
													on Thursday April 14<sup>th</sup>. I&rsquo;ll post such
													word as I am given of Scottish action taking place, though
													those interested can make their own contacts using the
