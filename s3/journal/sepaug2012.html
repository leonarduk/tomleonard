														Sitting in a cafe in Ireland last week I noticed
														illustrations on the wall of animals with their Gaelic
														names underneath. Under a badger was its Gaelic word&nbsp;<em>broc</em>.
														&ldquo;Brock&rdquo; for badger is confined more or less to
														children's stories now, though it was in use more widely
														in the nineteenth century, and came up in the poetry of
														both Allan Ramsay and Burns in the eighteenth.
													</p>
													<p>Brockburn Road, parallel to Leithland Road where I
														grew up in Pollok, takes its name from the Brock Burn at
														the foot of the road, &ldquo;burn&rdquo; being Scottish
														for a small river or rivulet. So in times past there were
														probably badgers in the land around the stream&mdash;a
														connection I hadn&rsquo;t thought of before.</p>
													<p>

															alt="brockburn" width="770" height="323" border="0" />
													</p>
													<p>&nbsp;</p>
													<p>
														Brockburn Road is also such as I had in mind when making
														the drawing that concluded my 1975 dialect sequence&nbsp;<em>Bunnit
															Husslin</em>, with little excerpts from some of the poems
														appearing like bubbles as it were from the pool of
														language of the community. The photograph overlooking
														Brockburn Road taken from Crookston Castle sometime in the
														early 1950&rsquo;s shows what I mean.

													It looks like it will be the second week of December I go

													up in the South Tyrol mountains not far from the border
													with Austria. The ceremony will take place at a spa hotel
													resort called the&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a

													a state-of-the-art pampering hideaway up in the mountains
													and reachable only by cable car. This is what I call
													definitely a good review. If only I could get some of those
													miserable Scottish bastards who have slagged me off over
													the years to be forced to come and do some humble
													massaging. How nice it will be to be walk about as a poet,
													snoking up free crystal mountain air and having a Caspar
													David Friedrich type gaze over the Dolomites.

												<div style="text-align: left;">The
													Austrian-German-speaking South Tyrolean district of Italy
													harboured in NC Kaser someone who apparently, like the
													Wiener Gruppe with whom his work can be connected, knew
													intuitively and artistically the relationship between lower
													case, phonetic non-standard, non-cosy dialect; and wider
													progressive prosody in relation to a wider-scale grasp of
													language and the politics of power. Yep, this aint just
													another of those "poetry prizes" that are usually
													tantamount to Death Certificates from the British State in
													conjunction with the TLS - Radio Four poetry mob. This is
													one I am really pleased to be getting.</div>

														Have begun correcting the first draft of the
														printer&rsquo;s proofs for my forthcoming&nbsp;<em>Definite
															Articles.</em> It seems it may be after Christmas in January
														or February&mdash;Etruscan Books have publication forecast
														simply as &ldquo;Winter&rdquo;&mdash; before the book
														appears. A pity it probably won&rsquo;t make it before
														Christmas, but one of the benefits of working with a small
														publisher at least is that though it can take longer, you
														can be sure you get it right: spacing, font for titles,
														details that a big publisher might just go ahead and do or
														give you one shot at suggesting alternative, with Etruscan
														I can have a thorough say in it all. Publisher Nicholas
														Johnston likes to make sure I am completely happy with the
														end result (including the cover which I have designed
														along with Sonya) before it&rsquo;s bound, which is one of
														the reasons it is great working with him.

													I was sent a copy of a 1979 book of poems&nbsp;<em>Another
														Fire becoming a City</em> translated from the Arabic of the
													Iraqi Kurd Salah Faiq, with illustrations by his partner
													Haifa Zangana. I was very taken by the book, and ordered
													secondhand the only other book by the poet I could
													find,&nbsp;<em>The Lode, the word </em>of 1985. Salah Faiq,
													who had been imprisoned in the past for his efforts in the
													Kurdish liberation struggle, was living in London when both
													these books were published by Melmoth. The second volume
													was introduced by the poet David Gascoyne.

												<div style="text-align: left;">
													<p>
														I know nothing of Salah Faiq&rsquo;s whereabouts since

													<p>Have received word today I am the recipient of an
														award called the N.C. Kaser poetry award given from the
														South Tyrolese town of Lana in northern Italy. Norbert C
														Kaser was a poet from the district who died in 1978. The
														Norwegian poet &Oslash;yvind Rimbereid &mdash;who has
														translated me&mdash;was the last winner of the biennial
														award in 2010, and he nominated me for it this year.</p>
													<p>Looking at a webpage reporting &Oslash;yvind
														Rimbereid&rsquo;s receipt of the award in 2010 my
														computer&rsquo;s garbled translation of the German on that
														page describes the prize as "looking at literature beyond
														the corporate patronage and predictable developments on
														poetry" and being " given to poets who move through
														artistic independence and aesthetic risk often at the
														edges of the large attention and carry the seal as an
														open, always sporadic language site.&rdquo;</p>
													<p>An artistically independent aesthetically risky
														sporadic language site. Suits me. My Glasgow lungs are
														looking forward to breathing some pure Tyrolean mountain
														air in a couple of months when I go over for the ceremony.</p>

														The CCA in Sauchiehall Street used to be the Third Eye
														arts centre years ago, and an exhibition is being held
														there for a few weeks displaying archive material from the
														seventies. I&rsquo;ll be giving a reading/talk on Friday
														evening September 7<sup>th</sup>, for which the publicity
														blurb states T<em>om Leonard will give a reading and
															peformance of his poetry that will include a work for
															tape and narrator largely made on the Third Eye
															Centre&rsquo;s own tape machines in 1975. He will in
															passim share his memories of events and performances at
															the Third Eye Centre and its directors the writer friend
															Tom McGrath, and Chris Carrell.</em>
													</p>
													<p>
														The work for tape and narrator is&nbsp;<span
															style="font-weight: normal;"><em>My Name is
																Tom</em>,</span> the tape components of which I put together on
														Revox tape machines in a Third Eye room which I had asked
														Tom McGrath to let me use for a few days for the purpose.
														Bob Cobbing had invited me to do something for his Eighth
														International Sound Poetry Festival in London in May 1975,
														and that was what I was working towards. I made two pieces
														for tape, narrator/singer and placards: the other was a
														similarly constructed work called&nbsp;<em>Ach
															Caledonia.</em>
													</p>
													<p>
														I got a lift down to London in a car with James Kelman and
														friends going to the England &ndash; Scotland football
														match, and the world premiere of my works duly took place
														in the Poetry Society on the evening of the day in which
														Scotland had been gubbed 5-1.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve performed
														the pieces numerous times since, especially&nbsp;<em><span
															style="font-weight: normal;">My Name is Tom,</span> </em>though
														I have rarely performed it this past 15 years or so.
													</p>
													<p>In 1978 what I called a descriptive score was
														published by Lawrence Upton&rsquo;s Good Elf press in
														London; fifteen pages for the musical notation of which I
														was helped by my friend the composer John Purser. This is
														pages 8, 9 and 11.</p>

													<p>Much so-called mainstream poetry is result and
														extended function of mainstream classroom teaching: the
														latter defines the former&rsquo;s parameters, constraints,
														exigencies. The students of the one become the producers
														of the other.</p>
													<p>European sound poets of the seventies I knew could
														attempt breakout sometimes through a seemingly desperate
														aural sign language set against conventional language
														supposedly drained of meaning for them. Each of the poets
														I invited to the Sound and Syntax festival in Glasgow in
														1978&nbsp; seemed to show engaged commitment, some
														structural passion or non-wanky humour however
														&ldquo;elitist&rdquo;&nbsp; the cry against the narrowness
														of their popular appeal. Only one, Steve McCaffery,
														blagged his way onto the stage during the weekend and the
														work I thought so slick and super-competent, I regretted
														the festival didn&rsquo;t end during his performance with
														a dadaistic rifle shot from the back of the hall.</p>
													<p>In Glasgow a deal of&nbsp;visual art has been
														functioning from artschool department to likeminded
														gallery curator. &nbsp;Some claim the result as
														inheritance from Beuys. It's not art for art&rsquo;s sake,
														but context-of-art for context of gallery&mdash;even when
														set out of doors. Like most theory-art, it is the
														articulation of reflection-upon: reflection-of-art for
														those who claim a surfeit of forced digestion of false
														history. It becomes the triumph of Intertextuality,
														original texts the disjected booster rockets, their
														supposed historic contexts pathologised as fossil fuel.</p>
													<p>
														Likewise literary theory on poetry&mdash;peculiarly on
														poetry as distinct from prose&mdash;often seems to be
														about poets as bastards outed as trying to put one over
														the reader.&nbsp; I feel sorry for some younger people
														trying to make their way artistically, or just as humans,
														aha, through this. Proferred huts in the blasted heath of
														recession. Yes, baby: it&nbsp;<em>is</em> cold outside.
														But if you can&rsquo;t face the cold, maybe you should at
														least face the self which can&rsquo;t face it. That might
														require more courage, and less composure. You would have
														to consider that there is such a thing as a self. And that
														could put some theory ball right up on the fucking slates.
													</p>
													<p>Meanwhile, many &ldquo;victories&rdquo; of
														impeccable, cleanly executed inconsequentiality, as
														politically safe as &mdash; galleries, and classrooms.
														Like the deadening mainstream</p>

														Calum rarely spoke about his own life. An adopted child,
														he&nbsp; was taken from Glasgow to Tiree when young. His
														childhood apparently was not a happy one. The Tiree
														background was responsible for a Highland strain in a deal
														of his work. He collected editions of
														Macpherson&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Ossian</em>, and my own copy
														of that I gave Calum years ago as it was an edition he
														didn&rsquo;t have.
													</p>
													<p>
														&ldquo;Carthon&rdquo; forms a chapter in Ossian/
														Macpherson&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Fragments of Ancient
															Poetry. </em>Prefatory scene-setting of the poem states that
														an uncle of Fingal sought refuge from a storm at sea at
														Balclutha on the river Clyde. There in time he married,
														but fled seaward again after a dispute, leaving his wife
														behind. Pregnant, she died soon after giving birth to a
														son called Carthon, &ldquo;murmur of the waves.&rdquo;
														When the boy was three, Balclutha was sacked and burnt to
														the ground. Carthon was taken by a nurse for safety into
														the country where he grew up. As a man he sought to avenge
														the sacking of Balclutha, but was unwittingly killed by
														his own father in a combat. The poem is set the night
														before his death.

													You can feel out on a limb doing things like the stuff i

													The heavy scoring out of the August 10 entry is like

													build up the remaining words and their connections that
													show through, reminds me of when I was making my soundpoem
													stuff in the seventies, and in doing my&nbsp;<em>My
														Name is Tom </em>where the narrator/singer has to struggle to
													get the words through to be heard against a double
													soundtrack, I had in mind Nielsen&rsquo;s instructions to
													the snare drummer in his Fifth Symphony, to
													&ldquo;improvise as if to drown the progress of the
													orchestra&rdquo;. As if, but not quite.

													<strong>August 10th</strong>
												</p>
												<p>Edinburgh Festival starting now. Three years since
													that coincided with a&nbsp;Scottish review of books having
													as lead a most carmudgeonly damned-with-faint-praise review
													of&nbsp;Outside the Narrative. Save me from the Scots, I
													have a number of times remarked to others on this); the
													thirty years' work which take up most of the book was more
													or less simply ignored, and a page and a half was spent
													raking back and forth in ponderous prose whether or not
													that part containing my phonetic Glasgow poems of thirty to
													forty years ago could be considered genuine literature. The
													headline had the stigmatising dismissal-word
													&ldquo;patter.&rdquo; It eventually said no anthology of
													Scottish poetry could exclude this work since it was there,
													but it would be unlikely to be understood in
													Australia.&nbsp; Being &ldquo;serious about words&rdquo; is
													a big thing in these parts, though its promulgators are not
													quite so serious about language, though they do not know
													that. &nbsp;Language is not restricted to dictionary, which
													is trailer, not engine. But that would be over the head, or
													worse, the undermining of the core personal identity, of
													critics such as this; the standing by discrete
													&ldquo;Word&rdquo; they see as the burden of their essence.
													It is how they understand God, and the god of their own
													being that they are tasked with overseeing in print.</p>
												<p>A deal of Scottish literary criticism, though
													especially from males, is cursed with this stuff. At root
													it is not actually a Catholic versus Protestant matter,
													though that has particular historical figuring in Scotland;
													for my own part as a writer, save me from the Catholic
													patriarchs (well, I upped and walked) &ndash; as much as
													the Muslim and Jewish ones to boot. But there are
													antipodes&nbsp;within these different religions, or
													religous parties as I think of them; and as I have
													previously written in this journal, one level of the
													patriarchy debate can be instanced as &ldquo;movement for
													peace and social justice&rdquo; &nbsp;versus self-appointed
													defence of sacrosanct text; the latter often characterising
													themselves as, and attempting to act as, genital police.</p>
												<p>Nor is it a matter of Left and Right. In the eighties
													I would sometimes be reading at both Communist or SWP
													events. I was glad enough to read at either, I had people
													with whom I was friendly in both as I still have today, and
													I pick my way through theirs and other Left publications
													for that which I find instructive or useful. It was
													noticeable that the Communist do&rsquo;s would be in some
													ways like a good church social; decent folk who could enjoy
													themselves singing Burns at a Burns Supper, and who
													welcomed you as one on the Left but would get a bit
													uncomfortable with poems with swearwords in them or that
													were in any way, as they would see it, inclined to the
													bourgeouis individualism of the experimental; the Word was
													very sacrosanct indeed: the Word was of The Folk, and the
													Folk were tradition-bearers.&nbsp; The SWP on the other
													hand, who unlike the Communists were mainly under 35, would
													welcome your work the punkier the better if they could find
													time enough to clear a space for you to read among the rock
													groups&rsquo; gear that would usually clutter the stage;
													and the first few minutes of a reading would be spent
													trying to establish with the audience that the friend and
													organiser who had asked you to read had not welcomed into
													the nest of elevated consciousness one of these maverick
													poet wankers that had no political consciousness whatever.
													For the Communists, MacDiarmid was the guardian of the
													Word, Burns the guardian of the Folk. Communism was the
													higher form of Presbyterianism that a thinking furth of
													communism today considers, overtly or subvertly, a
													democracy of intellect that is purportedly the essence of
													&ldquo;Scottishness&rdquo;. This the &ldquo;self&rdquo;
													that can lurk under the &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo;
													proposition hovering around debates on the independence
													referendum&mdash; debates about which I am unfortunately
													already terminally bored before they have even properly
													begun. Whose self is being bodied, and for why? Is this
													self&nbsp;prescriptive rather than&nbsp;descriptive? Is
													watermarking the text of an essentialist self not of
													the&nbsp;essence of patriarchy?</p>
												<p>Back to my mother, and to the mother of James Thomson
													the poet on whose work and life I spent fifteen years of my
													own life studying. Within the Scottish Protestantism that
													was the religion and culture into which Thomson&rsquo;s
													mother was born, she chose to follow the preacher Edward
													Irving who died in 1834. He followed upon the anti-Elect
													preaching of the Rhu Church of Scotland minister John
													MacLeod Campbell, who had preached effectively against the
													notion of the predetermined Elect, that in actuality Christ
													was available to each and every person in their present
													here-and-now existence; as I described MacLeod
													Campbell&rsquo;s preaching in Chapter One of&nbsp;Places of
													the Mind, &ldquo;the love shown by Christ was presently and
													constantly available, throughout each person&rsquo;s
													existence. This forgiveness and love was not a thing to be
													owned, or achieved, but was a given state of being to be
													realised and acknowledged. Don&rsquo;t try to do good to
													win God&rsquo;s love; realise God&rsquo;s love and you will
													try to do good.&rdquo;</p>
												<p>This here-and-now availability of the infinite, the
													not-discrete, Irving subsumed into preaching that the
													release from earthly suffering with the coming of the
													Messiah would be harbingered by evidence shown through
													ordinary people of what the Apostles had manifested
													as&nbsp; &ldquo;the gift of tongues&rdquo;: the holy spirit
													of unknown tongues supposedly gifted at Pentecost. Women in
													Irving&rsquo;s congregation during service began then to
													display such glossolalia, emanating dramatic sounds
													asserting possession of the holy spirit of here-and-now
													against the constraining, discrete patriarchal word
													preordained to define and enclose them in unalterable
													narrative even before they were born. The word of these
													women&rsquo;s bible understood through Irving was a
													summons, if only for a little while, against that word of
													patriarchy itself. Let us just say that Irving, and the
													women who followed him, got very bad reviews indeed.</p>
												<p>Thomson, in a letter written not long before he died,
													described his mother&rsquo;s portrait of Irving
													&ldquo;under yellow gauze&rdquo; that was kept at home in
													his childhood. Reading that I thought of my own home with
													the portrait of the Sacred Heart that used to mean so much
													to my own mother, once sneeringly dismissed by a visiting
													Scottish academic as merely a symbol of fascism. (The old
													Scottish &ldquo;Christians have faith Catholics have
													superstition&rdquo; probably lurking under that.) My mother
													and James Thomson&rsquo;s mother both worked hard all their
													life, working hard for their children, even when the
													children did not appreciate that fully. One was reared to
													believe that Catholicism was the product of the Antichrist;
													the other that such work had been found at the Reformation.
													&nbsp;Were there a heaven, which I have no reason to
													expect, these two women would be friends there. They can be
													so in the imaginative history that is literature; and in
													the here and now, taken.</p>
												<p>The opening of the preface to my book on
													Thomson&nbsp;Places of the Mind, now out of print, I
													append. The book, seen into print, was first welcomed with
													a blast of at the time an odd-seeming hatred from a
													Scottish male writing in an English Sunday newspaper; he at
													least had the dignity, as I mentioned some time ago in this
													journal, privately to send me a letter of apology a year
													later. Re-reading below and above, maybe small wonder
													instinctive hate and difficulties.</p>
												<p>
													<em>The debate between the behavioural determinist and
														those who believe in the universal democracy of the
														individual consciousness, is not of recent development.
														Some have seen in it the debate between a law-making angry
														God the Father of the Old Testament, and a loving and
														forgiving Jesus Christ, of the New. For a person to be
														born having already inherited the responsibilty for making
														a perfect father so angry, the children must needs have
														been very bad indeed. But if one was convinced that in
														essence one was very bad indeed, it might prove difficult
														to be convinced at the same time that one was worthy in
														any capacity to be loved. A belief in the redemptive
														superhumanity of Christ might be founded therefore on the
														startling proposition that Christ had the capacity to love
														that which his father had not thought necessarily lovable
														at all. It was but a step to the silent thought that the
														triumph of the Son in his Atonement was not to atone for
														the sins of humanity against the Father, but to atone for
														the sins of the Father against humanity.</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													<em>If the Father thought one's body loathsome and
														worthy of torment, it might be liberating to be assured
														one should on the contrary love one's self as well as
														one's neighbour. If one loved one's self, body and all,
														one might even be able to love one's neighbour, body and
														all, without feeling too guilty about it, or without
														thinking there must be something wrong with them if they
														felt the same way about you. But whilst loving one's own
														body, one should nonetheless clear one's mind and heart of
														what was contrary to love: anger or the desire for
														vengeance. One should forgive the Father, in other words,
														for hating you so much. This, eighty years before Freud's
														Interpretation of Dreams, was the burden of Shelley's
														lyric drama Prometheus Unbound, in which the tortured
														Prometheus forgives Jove for torturing him, and thus
														brings about, through the agency of the god of Necessity -
														called Demogorgon - the overthrow of Jove from Heaven, and
														the union of the male Prometheus with the cosmic female
														creative force, Asia. Prometheus is not Jove&rsquo;s son,
														but has sided with humanity against the angry god. When
														Prometheus accepts himself in his physical suffering and
														liberates himself from the desire for vengeance, he
														becomes of necessity more fit to rule in conjunction with
														the creative female, than the old god of repression who
														caused the suffering in the first place.</em>
