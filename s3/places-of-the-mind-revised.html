													<em><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></em><em><i>&nbsp;</i></em><strong><b><span
															style="font-size: 18pt;">CHAPTER
																ONE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b></strong>
												</p>
												<p style="text-align: center;">Published 1993; some
													small revisions Chapters 1 and 2 made 2018 mainly adding
													details of Thomson's young sister</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>In early nineteenth century Scotland the public
													statement of Christian beliefs known as the Westminster
													Confession of Faith was commonly read and learned in
													schools and homes along with the Shorter and the Longer
													Catechisms. Approved by the General Assembly of the Church
													of Scotland in 1647, the Confession stated, in Chapter
													Three, that "some men and angels are predestinated unto
													everlasting life" and "their number is so certain and
													definite, that it cannot be either increased or
													diminished." This "elect unto glory" was chosen by God
													"before the foundation of the world was laid...without any
													foresight of faith or good works, or perseverance in either
													of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions,
													or causes moving him there unto".</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Wherefore they who are
													elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ; are
													effectually called unto faith in Christ by his Spirit
													working in due season; are justified, adopted, sanctified,
													and kept by his power through faith unto salvation. Neither
													are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called,
													justified, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.</p>
												<p>In 1825 the Parish of Row near Helensburgh in the
													Firth of Clyde appointed a new minister, the Rev. John
													MacLeod Campbell. Campbell thought many of his parishioners
													were influenced by their notion of the Elect to see the
													Atonement as a kind of limited insurance policy drawn up
													for a predetermined number of policy holders: "instead of
													resting on the character of God as revealed in Christ, they
													looked upon the death of Christ as so much suffering - the
													purchase-money of heaven to a certain number, to whom it
													infallibly secured heaven." Christianity became a kind of
													distorted selfishness based on fear: "so long as the
													individual is uncertain of being the subject of love to his
													God, and is still without any sure hold of his personal
													safety in the prospect of eternity, it is in vain to
													attempt to induce him to serve God under the power of any
													purer motive than the desire to win God's love for himself,
													and so to secure his own happiness."</p>
												<p>
													What each individual needed, Campbell believed, was to have
													"personal assurance" of God's love as something already
													given and constantly present, not as something to be won or
													to fear being withdrawn. But such assurance could not be
													"unless Christ had died for <em><i>all,</i></em> and unless
													the Gospel announced him as "<em><i>the gift of
															God to every human being</i></em>". The Atonement had to be
													understood as both universal and individually specific;
													Christ had not died for the generality of "humanity" nor
													the exclusiveness of "the elect". He had died for each and
													every specific person alone, in that person's being: the
													love shown by Christ was presently and constantly
													available, throughout each person's existence. This
													forgiveness and love was not a thing to be owned, or
													achieved, but was a given state of being to be realised and
													acknowledged. Don't try to do good to win God's love;
													realise God's love and you will try to do good.
												</p>
												<p>
													Campbell's preaching stirred up fervour. There were stories
													of local people on their deathbeds having strange powers
													and visions of "a new dawn" in the church. But the greatest
													stir came about with the publication in 1829 of the memoir
													of a young woman, Isabella Campbell, who had died of
													tuberculosis 2 years earlier in the farmhouse of Fernicarry
													at the head of the Gareloch. The author of the memoir was a
													friend of Campbell's, Rev Robert Storey, who as Isabella's
													minister had often visited Isabella with MacLeod Campbell
													during Isabella's last illness. The 482-page memoir <em><i>Peace
															in Believing</i></em> quickly went through several editions. It
													told how after the death of her father and her brother,
													Isabella had experienced religious doubts until before she
													died she found "peace in believing" through "personal
													assurance" of salvation. This she had described
													enthusiastically to her many bedside visitors, and the last
													moments of her life were described in the memoir like the
													passing of a beautiful saint: "she opened her eyes
													suddenly, and clasping her hands looked upwards with a look
													of such inconceivable transport as made many present
													exclaim, 'Surely God is here!'... Her whole countenance
													seemed to shine, and all present confessed they had never
													pictured to themselves an object half so lovely."
												</p>
												<p>There had been constant prayer meetings round
													Isabella's deathbed led by her sister Mary. A visitor at
													the time of Isabella's death was struck by the attitude of
													Mary and her friends:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I was with them for two
													or three days after she died, assisting to make their
													mournings, and truly I thought them most wonderful people.
													Instead of mourning, Miss Campbell and some of her friends
													who came to visit her, seemed to be rejoicing in spirit;
													and I actually heard them say that they thought it ought to
													be white, instead of black, that Mary should wear for her.
													Certainly they have no cause to mourn on her account, and
													it shews their want of selfishness, when they can rejoice
													in her happiness, instead of mourning their own loss. I
													was, indeed, sometimes almost ready to think that I had
													never been amongst real Christians before, and that I
													myself was only one in name. They can talk with such
													frequency of their rapturous feelings of joy which they
													experience, their faith seems to carry them so far, that
													when speaking of the joys of the heavenly world, one would
													think that faith is almost swallowed up in sight. When the
													name of Jesus is mentioned they are filled with rapture of
													love, and their love to one another seems to burn with
													fervency; and in a word, they seem to be altogether lifted
													above the world, and to live only for God.</p>
												<p>Mary Campbell herself now became a focus of religious
													enthusiasm in the region. In becoming this she was helped
													on her way by another minister friend of Storey's who came
													on preaching tours in the region in 1828 and 1829. This
													minister was called Edward Irving.</p>
												<p>
													Irving had been an Edinburgh University divinity student at
													the same time as Storey, and when preaching in the Firth of
													Clyde he stayed in Storey's manse at Rosneath. Irving's own
													Church of Scotland parish was in London and in that city he
													had early acquired a formidable reputation as an orator.
													Soon after his arrival in 1823 his sermons had become
													fashionable with London society, and notable literary
													figures were amongst those who knew him and who praised his
													powers of public speaking. De Quincey called him "by many
													degrees, the greatest orator of his age", and Coleridge -
													whom Irving used to visit weekly at his home in Highgate -
													wrote "I hold that Edward Irving possesses more of the
													spirit and purpose of the first Reformers, that he has more
													of the Head and the Heart, the Life, the Unction, and the
													genial power of Martin Luther, than any man now alive." But
													some of the society and literary notables became
													disenchanted with Irving's growing involvement, from around
													1825, in interpreting the prophetic books of the Bible. He
													became friends with a group which from 1825 for six years
													met annually for a week to discuss the interpretation of
													the Prophetic Books. These &ldquo;Albury Conferences&rdquo;
													took place in the large home in Albury in Surrey of the
													wealthy banker Henry Drummond. Some Anglican clergy and
													believers attended, as well as Scots including on the first
													two occasions Robert Storey of Roseneath. Irving and Mary
													Campbelled, and the same Greenock publisher who issued in
													1829 Storey's <em><i>Peace in Believing</i></em> issued
													that same year a pamphlet by Irving called <em><i>The
															Nature and Use of the Gift of Tongues</i></em>. Irving preached
													that the "miraculous gifts" of speaking in unknown tongues,
													miraculous healing, and the ability to prophesy, were
													phenomena that would be restored to the Church on Christ's
													Second Coming. This, he told the huge crowds who attended
													his sermons &ndash; he made preaching tours in Scotland in
													1828 and 1829, was in Roseneath both years, and had an
													audience estimated at 10,000 in Dumfries - was an event
													soon to take place. The French Revolution could be
													interpreted as the opening of the Seventh Seal of <em><i>Revelation</i></em>.
													The days of the "latter rain" were at hand: Christ's second
													coming, and the founding of the New Jerusalem, could be
													expected in about 40 years.
												</p>
												<p>Whereas MacLeod Campbell had preached that Christ is
													presently available to every person throughout their
													existence, Irving preached that the Holy Spirit had been
													presently available to Christ on earth: it was this which
													had kept Christ's human nature sinless, and this which had
													enabled Christ to work miracles. This was the power of the
													Holy Spirit given to the Apostles at Pentecost as a gift to
													the Church, and only "the evil heart of unbelief" had
													caused the power subsequently to disappear. It followed
													that if the unbelief was to disappear, perhaps the gifts
													would return.</p>
												<p>This at any rate was how his words were interpreted
													by Mary Campbell, who by the end of 1829 was in bed
													apparently suffering from the same illness which had killed
													her now locally famous sister. Irving later described how
													his preaching then affected Mary: "She came to see what for
													six or seven years I had been preaching in London, that all
													the works of Christ were done by the man anointed with the
													Holy Ghost, and not by the God mixing himself up with the
													man... She straightway argued, if Jesus as a man in my
													nature spake and thus performed mighty works by the Holy
													Ghost, which he even promiseth to me, then ought I by the
													same nature, by the same Spirit, to do likewise 'the works
													which he did, and greater works than these'." On Sunday
													March 30th 1830 the prayer session round Mary's bed was
													interrupted:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">When, in the midst of
													their devotion, the Holy Ghost came with mighty power upon
													the sick woman as she lay in her weakness, and constrained
													her to speak at great length, and with superhuman strength,
													in an unknown tongue, to the astonishment of all who heard,
													and to her own great edification and enjoyment in God.</p>
												<p>The "gift of tongues" had come to Fernicarry, and
													within a week it had spread across the Firth of Clyde to
													Port Glasgow. In that town lived two of Mary's enthusiast
													friends, the shipbuilding brothers George and James
													MacDonald. Former members of Campbell's congregation, they
													had added Irving's millenialism to their store of beliefs,
													and taken to preaching in the open air themselves. But
													their house was also host to the ubiquitous tuberculosis,
													and their sister Margaret, like Mary Campbell across the
													water, was confined to her bed. When news of Mary's
													speaking in tongues came with the ferry from Rosneath,
													Margaret MacDonald launched into effusions of her own:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">She said, "There will be
													a mighty baptism of the spirit this day," and then she
													broke forth in a most marvellous setting forth of the
													wonderful works of God, and as if her own weakness had been
													altogether lost in the strength of the Holy Ghost,
													continued with little or no intermission for two or three
													hours, in mingled praise, prayer and exhortation. At dinner
													time James and George came home as usual, whom she then
													addressed at great length, concluding with a solemn prayer
													for James that he might at that time be endowed with the
													power of the Holy Ghost. Almost instantly James calmly
													said, "I have got it." He walked to the window and stood
													silent for a moment or two... He then with a step and
													manner of the most indescribable majesty, walked up to
													Margaret's bedside and addressed her in those words of the
													twentieth psalm, "arise and stand upright". He repeated the
													words, took her by the hand, and she arose.</p>
												<p>James sent a letter over to Mary Campbell "commanding
													her in the name of the Lord to arise". Mary afterwards
													described how she felt reading James MacDonald's letter:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">As I read every word came
													home with power, and when I came to the command to arise,
													it came home with a power which no words can describe; it
													was felt to be indeed the voice of Christ; it was such a
													voice as could not be resisted; a mighty power was
													instantaneously exerted upon me; I felt as if I had been
													lifted from off the earth, and all my diseases taken from
													off me at the voice of Christ. I was verily made in a
													moment to stand upon my feet, leap and walk, sing and
													rejoice.</p>
												<p>Across she came to the MacDonald's house in Port
													Glasgow. James and George themselves both shortly began
													speaking in the tongues during prayers, and within a short
													period the house had become "filled with people every day
													from all parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland." Not that
													everyone was impressed. A local minister accused Mary
													Campbell of being a hysteric who, having burst a blood
													vessel on her lung, had been pronounced healed and in good
													health by her doctor two weeks before her supposed
													"miraculous cure". Nor did he find the exhibitions of the
													"unknown tongues" any more convincing: "After a short
													silence, during which she kept her eyes fixed upwards, she
													commenced talking in unintelligible gibberish, and prayed
													that Christ would give to some of his members present the
													gift of interpretation, that the precious words of the
													Spirit might not be lost, but that the church might be
													edified. She continued speaking her unknown tongue for a
													considerable time, but the gift of interpretation was not
													bestowed; although one young man stood for upwards of half
													an hour, motionless as a statue; with his eyes fixed
													intently upon the ceiling, as if he expected to see the
													Spirit burst through the roof."</p>
												<p>Amongst the believers though the "tongues" were at
													first thought to be genuine though unknown earthly
													languages, a gift from God to enable missionary work to be
													done abroad without the chore of language-learning. This
													was Irving's own opinion when word of the Port Glasgow
													happenings reached him in London. A visiting American
													recorded his reaction to Irving's showing him an account
													sent him of the Port Glasgow events:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
													"I make no question but that it is the work of the HOLY
													SPIRIT, and a foretaste of that spiritual power which is to
													be poured forth on the reviving Church of Scotland... Was
													not the case the same in the apostles' days? Doth not St
													Paul indicate the fact when he says, "He that speaketh in
													an unknown tongue, speaketh not unto men but unto GOD, for
													no man understandeth him; howbeit in his spirit he speaketh
													mysteries".[see 1 Cor. 14:2] And is not the whole of St
													Paul's argument in the 14th Chapter of 1st <em><i>Corinthians</i></em>,
													founded upon the supposition that the saints then spoke in
													tongues which no man understood?"... These events," said
													he, "in my opinion, are nothing less than the outpouring of
													the Spirit, promised in all ages to the Church, and long
													withheld from the deadness of its faith."
												</p>
												<p>Irving and his congregation at the National Scotch
													Church, Regent Square, began to pray for the
													"manifestations of the gifts" to be bestowed in London.
													They did not come quickly, but finally the morning service
													before a congregation of 2,000 on Sunday October 30th 1831,
													a witness reported, "was very unexpectedly interrupted by
													the well-known voice of one of the sisters, who, finding
													she was unable to restrain herself, and respecting the
													regulation of the Church, rushed into the vestry, and gave
													vent to utterance; whilst another, as I understand, from
													the same impulse, ran down the side aisle and out of the
													church, through the principal door. The sudden, doleful,
													and unintelligible sounds, being heard by all the
													congregation, produced the utmost confusion". In succeeding
													weeks services threatened to become uncontrollable as more
													and more people, especially women, found themselves "in the
													power". Commonly a loud outburst of incomprehensible speech
													would be followed by exclamations and exhortations of a
													Biblically phrased character, taken by others as
													translation of what had gone before.</p>
												<p>
													There was a problem with all this regarding the owners of
													Regent Square Church, which was the official place of
													worship for the Royal Caledonian Asylum, an asylum for the
													orphaned and indigent children of Scottish servicemen and
													marines in London but not entitled to parochial relief. The
													children had a reserved place in the church gallery each
													week, and the trust deeds owned by the Asylum specified
													that church worship be "according to the doctrines, forms
													of worship and mode of discipline of the Established Church
													of Scotland." <em><i>The Times</i></em> was amongst those
													who repeatedly attacked the goings-on, calling the
													behaviour "a disgrace at once to European reason and human
													civilisation". It campaigned for the trustees to remove
													Irving from his pulpit, and on May 2nd 1832 the Presbytery
													of London ruled that he had "rendered himself unfit to
													remain the minister of the National Scotch Church
													aforesaid, and ought to be removed therefrom in pursuance
													of the conditions of the trust-deed of the said church."
												</p>
												<p>About 800 of the Regent Square congregation moved on
													with Irving, settling after a few months in premises in
													Newman Street, off Oxford Street. The following year the
													Church of Scotland - that "Babylonian confederacy" as
													Irving now called it - removed him altogether from Church
													of Scotland ministry. MacLeod Campbell had already been
													expelled in 1831. In Irving's opinion the clergy who made
													up the contemporary Church of Scotland lacked the spiritual
													integrity of their Reformation forefathers: "The gifts of
													the Spirit for the office are not looked for by the
													Presbyters, but certificates of professors, and petty
													attainments in literature and science". The events in Port
													Glasgow and London had been an attempt to restore the
													church to the days of its early apostlehood. Welcoming the
													first news of the miraculous events at Fernicarry and Port
													Glasgow, Irving had written: "I believe that the day of
													carpenters and fishermen is come again, and the day of
													masters in arts and doctors in divinity is gone by."</p>
												<p>Mary Campbell after her possession by the tongues in
													1831 had married a lawyer by the name of Caird, and as Mrs
													Caird travelled south to settle in Albury amongst the
													community there around Henry Drummond. Irving described
													Mary as &ldquo;a saint of God.&rdquo; It had been one of
													this Albury community, John B Cardale, who was sent north
													to Port Glasgow in 1831 to report back on Mary and the
													&ldquo;tongues&rdquo; phenomenon. Cardale&rsquo;s wife had
													subsequently become the first to speak &ldquo;in the
													tongues&rdquo; in London, at a private prayer meeting
													praying for these &ldquo;gifts&rdquo;. But it was John
													Cardale himself who stood up speaking &ldquo;in the
													power&rdquo; during Irving&rsquo;s first service in Newman
													Street in October 1832. The import was that he was declared
													by the Holy Spirit the first new church
													&ldquo;apostle&rdquo; charged with receipt of divine
													inspiration and the power of its interpretation. Henry
													Drummond became the second &ndash; of twelve - soon after.
													But Cardale and Drummond were from a hierarchical and
													heavily liturgised High Anglican background. Irving and the
													Scottish members of the congregation at Newman Street were
													divorced from their context and base of Presbyterianism at
													Regent Square.</p>
												<p>A fully hierarchised apostolic church became set out
													&ldquo;in the power&rdquo; in the succeeding months by the
													new &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; principally Cardale and
													Drummond. Irving himself never claimed to speak "in the
													power" and - though not without evidenced disquiet -
													deferred to the new "apostles" who did. In the new
													apostolic church structural template twelve male apostles
													were at the top. Beneath each apostle, an "angel" or
													minister over a congregation would have superiority to
													presbyters, elders, and deacons. Irving, after his formal
													deposition from out the Church of Scotland in March 1833,
													had to kneel to apostle Cardale to be anointed "angel" at
													Newman Street to continue his ministry.</p>
												<p>
													Women in the new structure could only rise as high as
													deaconesses for "the visiting of solitary females"; but
													their speaking in the tongues&mdash; the most dramatic and
													propulsive feature of the millenarian movement in London
													and Port Glasgow&mdash;was now discouraged, even censured:
													"it was declared that although the Lord would direct His
													apostles through them, or through infants even, whenever it
													might please Him to do so, still it was not His will or
													way, and only to the dishonour of the man so to use them".
													It was also "declared" that if any woman "has had, or
													imagines she has had, revelations or spiritual experiences
													of any kind", interpretation of this should be referred up
													the structure as far as the apostles if need be, and the
													reply could be passed back down through the hierarchy; "and
													even were its result to be the infliction of some
													ecclesiastical censure, the sisterly deaconess would be at
													her side to share and soften it." In other words the women
													had to shut up and stop setting the pace, or leave. Many
													did. The men were in charge now, with <em><i>Corinthians</i></em>
													1 14:34 - "let your women keep silence in churches" - as
													validation.
												</p>
												<p>
													This new hierarchy did not go down well with the fraternal
													congregations on the Firth of Clyde, where the MacDonalds
													had hired a private chapel in Greenock. Neither they nor
													MacLeod Campbell would have anything to do with the two
													leading "apostles", of the new church when they came north
													to attempt a fusion of forces. However a London-approved
													church did finally open in Greenock under the care of
													"angel" Walter Tait, a former Church of Scotland minister
													in Edinburgh. The church opened on August 31st 1834, and
													the <em><i>Greenock Telegraph</i></em> carried a report:
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">On such an occasion it
													was naturally expected that some of the peculiarities of
													their form of worship would be manifested; accordingly in a
													few seconds after Mr Tait entered the pulpit for the
													forenoon service, Mrs Provan, a very respectable member of
													the congregation, cried out, in an awfully shrill and
													vehement voice, "This is the place! This is the house of
													God, and the gate of heaven! Enter in ye people, and
													rejoice!" etc. etc. The sounds were so very unearthly and
													astounding, that it was only those who were very near her
													that understood the words. There was, however, no
													exhibition of the "unknown tongues"; which we believe will
													ultimately form no part of their creed.</p>
												<p>Then Irving, though now ill, travelled north to
													Greenock himself. The local newspaper again reported on
													October 25th, albeit misspelling his name:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Mr Irvine, the great
													unknown tongue apostle, arrived at Greenock on Tuesday from
													Liverpool, via the Glasgow steamer, and has taken up
													residence among the disciples in the west for a time. The
													Rev. gentleman looks tolerably well, although still having
													the appearance of indisposition about him. It is
													anticipated that Mr. I. will take part in the worship of
													the church lately planted at Greenock. This sect are
													increasing slowly in numbers while the Campbellites, under
													the auspices of Mr MacDonald, are decreasing by division on
													different points of doctrine. It appears now that Mr Tait
													by his labours will be able, with the assistance of the
													London Society, to keep a stronghold for the Irvinites in
													the west of Scotland. Several of his disciples from the
													metropolis have visited Greenock since the foundation of
													the church there, and are zealous in preaching their
													peculiar tenets on the high-ways and bye-ways.</p>
												<p>Irving moved on to Glasgow, from where, according to
													a transcription published by Cardale, he wrote expressing
													on the one hand sadness at being so far from his
													congregation at Newman Street, on the other rebuking
													himself and they for having resisted the new order they now
													found themselves contained by: "Oftentimes I think it is
													the Lord's gentle hand, breaking that bond by degree
													between me and my flock, which threatened to grow up into a
													kind of necessity, and even to pass over into idolatry. O
													how I love them! how I am thankful to them! how I am laden
													with their benefits! And I am sure that their love to me is
													stronger than my love to them, and I do see it is of the
													great goodness and tenderness of God to take order that
													such affection should be stayed from passing over into
													unholiness; and that he hath done us a great favour to put
													us so far asunder, and for such a time, that we might try
													our hearts, and prove ourselves that our mutual love is in
													the Lord."</p>
												<p>One follower of Irving from Regent Square not
													separated by his return north was a dressmaker born Sarah
													Kennedy who married in London in January 1834 and returned
													later in the year to her native Scotland. The extent of her
													millenial enthusiasm was evidenced in a letter written to
													her future sister-in-law on December 16th 1831, at the
													height of the controversy in London:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Dear Ann, I am very happy
													to hear you are so well and comfortable, as far as visable
													things are concerned, every blissing should be receved as
													from the hand of God - I have little to say about myself -
													but at this time I am wandering about in Sheepskins and
													goatSkins and in Dens and Caves of the Earth, My dear Ann I
													am anxious to lay up treasures where moth or rust cannot
													enter, and at this moment I am called onto forsack all for
													Christ - and I am happy for he maks me to rejoice in
													suffering and I believe this is the jerusalem that I am
													commanded to stay in, till the comforter be sent and we
													have not waited in vain for the drops are falling but soon
													there shall be a plentyfull shower for the Lord is coming
													to water his weary hineratance, oh Ann I cannot tell the
													life and light that I feel in the midst of trouble ---- I
													should be glade to see your face in the flesh, and that you
													might be a partaker of my joy. do not think I mean not what
													I say for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
													speaketh adeiu S. Kennedy burn this scrall it is not fit to
													be seen by any but you S Kennedy</p>
												<p>But Sarah did not see much of Irving in his new
													ministry north of the border, for he died on December 7th
													and was buried in the grounds of Glasgow Cathedral. Two
													weeks before Irving's death, on Sunday November 23rd, Sarah
													gave birth to a boy in Port Glasgow. The baby was given his
													father's name, and the following February James Thomson was
													baptised.</p>
