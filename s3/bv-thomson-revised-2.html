																CHAPTER TWO &nbsp;</span></b></strong>
												</p>
												<p style="text-align: center;">
													<strong><b><span style="font-size: 18pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1993
													- updated Sep 2018)&nbsp;<strong><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
													</b></strong>
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong><b>&nbsp;</b></strong>
												</p>
												<p>The town of Port Glasgow had a population of about
													6,000 people, which is to say about a sixth of the
													population of neighbouring Greenock - the largest sea-port
													in Scotland - about a mile west along the shore. Most of
													the ships entering or leaving Port Glasgow's 2 harbours
													traded with Glasgow city or other places on the Clyde; but
													an average of 7 vessels each month arrived from abroad -
													America, the West Indies, the East Indies, Canada, the
													Mediterranean. The main import was timber, almost 28,000
													tons of it being imported in the year of Thomson's birth.
													Much of this was stored in large warehouses on the shore
													front, while other such warehouses held alcohol and refined
													sugar, both of which were prominent in the trade of the
													place. The sea dominated local industry, the main
													manufacturies being of rope, sail-cloth and canvas, whilst
													the town shipyards worked almost exclusively on the
													construction of the steamboats with which the Firth of
													Clyde had become internationally associated since Bells
													Comet of 1812.</p>
												<p>Both sides of the newborn child's family lived in
													Port Glasgow. His mother was the daughter of Margaret
													Lawson, one of the town's 4 midwives; Margaret had been
													twice married and twice widowed. Her first marriage was in
													Edinburgh in 1791 to a George Parker by whom she had a son
													John. Then on 18th August 1798 Sarah was born - in Blantyre
													- "daughter natural to Alexander Kennedy soldier in
													Lochaber Regiment and Margaret Lawson College Parish
													Glasgow". The parents did not marry until five years later
													in the Gaelic Chapel, Glasgow, in September 1803, when her
													father Alexander was entered as a &ldquo;sawer&rdquo;.
													Their second daughter Margaret was born in 1806.</p>
												<p>Sarah Kennedy's own marriage took place at St Ann's,
													Limehouse, London, on January 12th, 1834. Her husband James
													Thompson was a merchant seaman 8 years younger than
													herself. Born in Logierait near Pitlochry in Perhshire, in
													1806, he alone in his family adopted the English spelling
													"Thompson" as his surname on his marriage and work
													documents. His father John Thomson (no "p") had worked as a
													weaver and small farmer at Logierarit before moving south
													to the Firth of Clyde with his wife Helen and their family
													of 6: Lillian (1799), Ann (1802), Charles (1804), James
													(1806), twins Susan and Helen (1808), and John (1811). A
													seventh child, Mary, had been then born in Port Glasgow in
													1817. The second oldest, Ann, was she to whom Sarah Kennedy
													wrote the millenialist letter of 1831.</p>
												<p>In Port Glasgow the 7-strong family of Helen and
													James had been poor: some of the children slept in a trunk
													on the floor, a fact some townsfolk reputedly liked to
													recall with mischief when Helen in later years as Mrs
													McLarty was owner and director of a sailcloth manufactory,
													and lived in a large house at Clune Park on the edge of the
													town.</p>
												<p>Church Street runs down to Port Glasgow harbour, and
													at its corner with Princes Street stood the house later
													claimed as where Sarah gave birth. The parish register
													entry of birth does not give the address, but simply reads
													"James Thomson mariner and Sarah Kennedy his spouse had a
													lawful son born 23rd Nov 1834 Bapt. 28 Feb 1835. Called
													James." The entry was not made though until May 1848, 6
													months before the boy's 14th birthday, and the spelling of
													the surname reflects the change from "Thompson" to
													"Thomson" as amended by the boy's school in London.</p>
												<p>In matters religious the "gift of tongues" ceased
													soon after 1834 to be a matter of public debate and
													scandal. George and James MacDonald both died in 1835, and
													the MacDonalds' small circle of adherents made no more
													public noise. One of their followers regretted in a
													memorial biography that the power of the Holy Spirit had
													withdrawn locally "into the retirement of the closet, or
													the circle of the few who alone have cherished it". Like
													the MacDonalds themselves the author thought Irving's
													congregation had been led astray by "men assuming the
													apostleship, and, by making the voice of the prophets
													subordinate to their superior office, gradually suppressing
													it."</p>
												<p>
													Seaman James Thompson worked in vessels registered at
													Greenock and Glasgow. In September 1836 he was enlisted for
													a few months on the new Glasgow registered <em><i>Mountaineer</i></em>,
													built with intention to trade to the British colony of
													Demarara in Guiana. Two of the <em><i>Mountaineer&rsquo;s
													</i></em> three owners lived locally in Scotland, the third, Thomas
													Wilson, was in Demerara itself. Slaves in the sugar
													plantations there and throughout the British colonies had
													been freed by the abolition of slavery in 1834. But until
													1838 they were still held in what was officially called an
													&ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo;. Ship building on the Clyde
													was an integral part of trade built on slavery in the
													colonies. Sugar and its refinement was part of this.
												</p>
												<p>
													Port Glasgow was described by the local minister in 1839
													for the forthcoming <em><i>Statistical Account of
															Scotland </i></em>thus: "In its general appearance the town
													presents an aspect of neatness and regularity, not often to
													be met with. The streets are straight, and for the most
													part cross each other at right angles; while the houses,
													pretty nearly equal in size, and generally white-washed,
													give to the whole a light and uniform appearance." The view
													from the hill overlooking Port Glasgow and the Firth he
													thought "not surpassed in grandeur and loveliness even by
													the most admired scenes of which England, and perhaps even
													Europe, can boast." There was poverty. A soup kitchen gave
													out a quart of soup and a roll to each of the poor who had
													a ticket, and an average of 80 quarts were given out each
													day except Sunday - when it was shut. The soup kitchen had
													been launched partly "to check intemperance among the
													poor", and intemperance was one thing the minister thought
													needed checking:
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">In the year 1790, with a
													population of 4,000, there were no less than 81 public
													houses in the town. It is gratifying to be able to state,
													that in March 1835, and with a population of about 6,000,
													the number of public houses had been reduced to 70. It
													would still be more gratifying to be able to add, that the
													practice of intemperance has diminished in the same
													proportion. Appearances, however, do not by any means
													warrant such a conclusion, and seem to indicate, that
													intemperance never prevailed among the lower classes of
													society to a wider and more alarming extent than in the
													present day.</p>
												<p>
													But by the time this report was written, Sarah and the
													family were removed to London. The <em><i>Mountaineer</i></em>
													had re-registered there in 1837. But when James Thompson
													enlisted as First Mate on a vessel in London in June 1837
													it was not on the <em><i>Mountaineer</i></em> bound for
													Demarara, but on another distant merchant trader&mdash; the
													423-ton <em><i>Eliza Stewart</i></em> bound for China. This
													was to be first of three such voyages Thompson made between
													1837 and 1840.
												</p>
												<p>In October 8th 1837, three months after he had left
													on the first of the voyages, a 10-month old infant daughter
													was baptised in Newman Street Church - the same church
													where Irving had been preaching as "angel" before his
													death. The infant was called Jane Bowler Thompson, and the
													entry adds simply that the date of birth was November 26th
													the previous year,1836. She had been born 3 days after her
													brother James's second birthday. Their father James
													Thompson was only with his family for 2 short stays between
													his three voyages to and from China: a month between May
													and June 1838, and 6 weeks between June and July 1839.
													While he was at sea a few months into his third voyage to
													China, the infant Jane caught measles from her brother
													James, and she died. She was buried in London in October
													1839 shortly before her third, and James's fifth, birthday.
													It was fully another 11 months before their father returned
													to London; and when he arrived he did so paralysed down his
													right side, having suffered a stroke while at sea. Sarah
													had become her husband and the boy James's sole source of
													support. At this point, according to a sometimes confused
													family account written in 1934 by a granddaughter of
													Sarah&rsquo;s sister Margaret, money was sent from Port
													Glasgow by Sarah&rsquo;s mother. The family account has it
													that the money was to train her as a court dressmaker.</p>
												<p>
													Though Port Glasgow had its poverty and poor housing, the
													east end of London presented poverty and poor housing on a
													much larger and more intense scale. The district of St
													Mary's in the parish of St-Georges-in-the-East where the
													family were settled and where the infant Jane was buried in
													1839, was the subject of a pioneering economic and social
													analysis five years later in 1844. The parish did not show
													London poverty at its worst, having been chosen for
													analysis as "an example of the <em><i>average
															condition</i></em> of the poorer classes of the metropolis," which
													meant it was "a population entirely above the wretched
													system of sub-letting corners of the same room".
													Nonetheless as an averagely poor district it was "one of
													those composed of dingy streets, of houses of small
													dimensions and moderate elevation, very closely packed in
													ill-ventilated streets and courts, such as are commonly
													inhabited by the working classes of the east end". Mary Ann
													Street, where the Thompsons lived in 1842, was a street of
													2- storey houses in a warren of streets midway between
													Commercial Street and Cable Street, not far from St
													Katherine Docks. It was 100 yards long, 9 yards wide, and
													described in the 1844 assessment as "well paved", "well
													lit", with "good" drainage and a "plentiful" water supply.
													However, "good" drains meant "good and clean surface
													drains"; and a "plentiful" supply of water was one that was
													"a plentiful supply three times a week" - for 2 hours at a
													time. Other streets in the surrounding area were worse off:
													"In many parts of St Georges in the East there is no
													drainage, and the kitchens, in some places, after heavy
													rains are stated to be several inches under water; which,
													when it recedes, leaves an accumulation of filth and dirt
													of the worst description." However even "good" surface
													drains as in Mary Ann Street were not good enough for
													public health in the absence of a continuous supply of
													water to clean them. This was recognised at the time:
												</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">But even supposing that
													all the houses had drains, and all the streets sewers, and
													that they had been properly constructed, so that they had
													the most approved form, diameter, and fall; still they
													would be in great measure useless, because they could not
													answer the purpose they were intended for, unless supplied
													with water: without a sufficient supply of water, to keep
													up a constant current flowing through the drain, the drain
													itself becomes positively injurious, generating and
													diffusing the very poison it was intended to prevent and
													remove.</p>
												<p>The most common male employment in the district was
													labouring, and a sixth of that was in the nearby docks. In
													descending order of frequency there were shoemakers,
													gunsmiths, carpenters, sailors, then a wide variety of
													trades of all sorts down to "ginger-beer-seller", "chair
													bottomer", and "house of ill fame." No details about the
													latter were entered upon, though the report on St Mary's
													District where the Thompsons lived, noted "at least 50"
													houses of prostitution. Attention was drawn to the problems
													caused by women's low pay, especially when the women were
													supporting families on their own: "we find much greater
													diversity of age, with very limited means, derived from the
													narrow range of employments for female hands, especially if
													unaccompanied by a vigorous frame and habits of bodily
													exertion. The extent of such employments, as compared with
													the number of struggling competitors for them, being always
													limited, their renumeration is low. The relative
													superiority of men's earnings over those of women, and even
													more over those of the women and children combined, in the
													metropolis, as compared with most of the manufacturing
													districts, is thus very conspicuously shown." The average
													rent in the district was "no less than 3/7d a week" in
													1844. A needlewoman could earn about 5/9d, though a court
													dressmaker, as distinct from an ordinary dressmaker, could
													hope to earn up to 17/-.</p>
												<p>
													The work took a terrible toll on women's health, as reports
													increasingly indicated. "No slavery is worse than the
													dressmaker's in London" one woman told a government
													inspector in 1843. Before the invention and patenting of
													the sewing machine it was a job which used up young women
													like Kate on her way early to work in Dickens's <em><i>Nicholas
															Nickleby</i></em>: "At this early hour many sickly girls, whose
													business, like that of the poor worm, is to produce with
													patient toil the finery that bedecks the thoughtless and
													the luxurious, traverse our streets, making towards the
													scene of their daily labour, and catching, as if by
													stealth, the only gasp of wholesome air and glimpse of
													sunlight, which cheers their monotonous existence during
													the long train of hours that make a working day."
												</p>
												<p>Hood's "Song of the Shirt" became famous in 1843.
													That was to be the year of Sarah Thompson's death.</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
													<img

														alt="hood song of the shirt" />
												</p>
												<p>For those trying to do the court dressmaking which
													payed more, there were the two busy "seasons", from April
													till the end of July, and from October until Christmas. But
													by the end of 1841 Mrs Thompson was in advanced pregnancy,
													and on the 4th of February 1842 she gave birth at 24 Mary
													Ann Street to another boy, whom she called John Parker
													Thompson after her late step-brother. She became ill, and
													sought help for her family. It was now that her connections
													with the prosperous Irvingite network came to some use.</p>
												<p>Regent Square Church was still the official place of
													worship for the boys of the Royal Caledonian Asylum in
													Islington; an asylum "for the maintenance and education of
													the children of soldiers sailors &amp; marines, natives of
													Scotland, who have died or been disabled in the service of
													their country, and of indigent Scotch parents, resident in
													London, not entitled to parochial relief." The Thompsons
													were now such parents, and application was made to have
													James taken in. Boys were admitted at the age of 8, and
													James would reach his 8th birthday on November 23rd that
													year.</p>
												<p>The Caledonian Asylum was a favourite charity of
													London-Scottish aristocracy and well-to-do. Fundraising
													balls and dinners were annual events, at which the boys who
													were the object of the charitable donations would be
													ceremonially marched round the room before their
													benefactors. These gala events were an integral part of the
													court calendar which court-dressmakers such as Mrs Thompson
													would labour to dress. The annual summer fancy dress ball
													in Willie's Rooms in 1842 was attended, The Times reported,
													by between eight and nine hundred:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">...a vast number of whom
													appeared in the rich and picturesque costumes worn at the
													Queen's Masque. The rooms perhaps never presented a more
													brilliant assemblage of rank and beauty. The boys of the
													Caledonian Asylum, attired in Highland kilts of the Royal
													tartan, preceded by the pipers of His Royal Highness the
													Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Sutherland, wearing the
													handsome Scotch mulls recently presented to them by command
													of Her Majesty, and attended by the officers of the
													institution, marched round the ball-room as usual, and were
													most warmly greeted. On returning to the ante-room they
													were inspected by His Grace the Duke of Wellington, who, in
													terms of great readiness and condescension, was pleased to
													express his admiration of their healthful appearance and
													martial demeanour.</p>
												<p>
													There was competition for the small number of vacancies
													that became available in the Asylum every 6 months. An
													application had first to be sponsored by someone already on
													the list of subscribers to Asylum funds who had given 10
													guineas or more as life subscription, or had annually given
													2 guineas in subscription before the sponsorship. The
													approval of a prosperous backer with interest in the asylum
													had first to be obtained. Irvingite connections could help,
													as there were well off professional and even aristocratic
													members in the new post-Irving developing chuch. At Albury
													Mary Campbell, as Mrs Caird, had acted with her husband as
													sometime lay chaplain to Lady Olivia Sparrow; and when Mary
													came north to Port Glasgow on a visit in 1839 a year before
													her death in 1840, she travelled with Lady Drummond, which
													prompted the scorn of the minister Robert Story whose <em><i>Peace
															in Believing</i></em> had first publicised the religious fervour
													of Mary's late sister Isabella: "Look at any seamstress,
													labouring early and late for a miserable subsistence, and
													at your present condition, your very servant arrayed in
													silken attire... Where you are I know not, but of this I am
													persuaded, you are not where Isabella left you."
												</p>
												<p>The seamstress Sarah Thompson and her disabled
													husband did manage to obtain sponsorship, that of a James
													Boyd, late of the Firth of Clyde and now co-director of a
													sugar-refining company in Breezer's Hill by London Dock.
													Once sponsored, an application was not thereby guaranteed
													success. Twice yearly the applications in hand were put to
													the vote of all the subscribers, the applications with the
													most votes then being matched with the small number of
													vacancies available. The application was endorsed with a
													statement of the family circumstances which the Thompsons
													then had witnessed by a magistrate, as required, at Lambeth
													Street Police Court Whitechapel on August 16th 1842. The
													application stated:</p>
												<p style="padding-left: 60px;">That the parents James
													Thompson born at Pitnacrea, Perthshire aged 37 years, Sarah
													Thompson born at Glasgow aged 42 years, reduced to poverty
													from the Father being incapable to follow his profession as
													a mariner in which he was actively employed as apprentice,
													seaman &amp; mate and served in the following ships</p>
