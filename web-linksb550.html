The publisher of Tom Leonard's last four books, Nicholas consulted Tom Leonard on all aspects of production throughout, Tom with wife Sonya designing the front covers on the sewn bindings. The finished product of the last two books, outside the narrative and Definite Articles, has had WordPower in Scotland then weigh in with contributory funding to have the books finally published under joint publisher imprint.
